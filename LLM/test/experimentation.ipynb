    "When the fish crosses this point, its friends in the river above can no longer hear it, since\n",
    "to enable this, the speed of the sound waves would have to exceed the speed of sound in the\n",

    "who fell into the jaws of a black hole: the astronaut would not be able to communicate with\n",
    "the base station on Earth, because the signals sent towards the outside would need to move\n",

    "where the speed with which the waterfall falls is equal to the speed of sound in the water, meaning\n",

       "'In this paper, the authors commemorate the half-century anniversary of Stephen Hawking\\'s discovery that \"black holes ain\\'t so black\" by describing its temperature with an absolute temperature proportional to its mass. They use a technique called dimensional analysis to derive the \"Hawking equation\" and explore its possible consequences. The authors acknowledge that the scientific value of this discovery remains largely unexplored, and they outline their plan to make it accessible to a wide audience. In particular, they focus on the \"dimensional analysis\" part of the task, which will be useful to gifted high school students, physics teachers, scientists and engineers, and'"
