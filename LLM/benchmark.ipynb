The authors use dimensional analysis to derive the Hawking temperature, a fundamental concept in modern astrophysics. They demonstrate that black holes have an absolute temperature, TH, which depends inversely on their mass, MBH. The authors also explore the physical implications of Hawking's discovery, including the evaporation of black holes and their entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper begins by introducing the concept of dimensional analysis, a tool used to study physical quantities with different dimensions. The authors then derive the Hawking temperature using dimensional analysis, starting from the assumption that a static black hole is characterized by its mass. They introduce the standard gravitational parameter, Gm, which is essential to the derivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors then discuss the physical meaning of Hawking's discovery, highlighting the implications of black holes having an absolute temperature. They also explore the concept of entropy, which is proportional to the area of the event horizon. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges of detecting Hawking radiation and the potential applications of analogue gravity, a field that aims to create physical systems that mimic the behavior of gravitational phenomena.\n",
