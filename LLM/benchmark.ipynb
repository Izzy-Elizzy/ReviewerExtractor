    "standard_summary = \"\"\"This paper presents a catalog of unobscured quasar candidates identified in the southern hemisphere using data from the KMTNet Synoptic Survey of Southern Sky (KS4). The KS4 data, covering roughly 2500 square degrees, reaches 5σ detection limits of around 22.1-22.7 AB magnitude in the BVRI bands. This data, combined with infrared photometry from surveys like 2MASS, VHS, and WISE, was used to select unobscured quasar candidates based on their colors and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting results. The final catalog contains 72,964 unobscured quasar candidates, with only 0.4% previously identified through spectroscopic observations. The selection method achieves an 87% recovery rate for spectroscopically confirmed bright quasars at z < 2 within the KS4 survey area. The number count of the candidates is comparable to that of spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the northern sky. This indicates that the approach used in this study is effective for searching for unobscured quasars in the southern sky. Future spectro-photometric surveys covering the southern sky, such as 7DS and SPHEREx, will enable further analysis and a deeper understanding of quasar populations in the southern hemisphere. The paper highlights the significance of studying quasars, particularly unobscured ones, as they provide valuable insights into the growth of supermassive black holes and their impact on host galaxies throughout cosmic time. The study validates the effectiveness of the selection method by comparing the results with spectroscopically confirmed quasars from other surveys, such as the Milliquas catalog and the DES Data Release 2. The analysis of the number counts per unit area and the comparison with the SDSS and DES samples confirm the robustness of the selection method. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of future spectro-photometric surveys for confirming the true nature of the identified candidates and for enhancing our understanding of quasar populations in the southern hemisphere.\"\"\""

    "large_book_summary = \"\"\"\"In this paper, the authors summarize and discuss the results of a survey of \"unobscured QSOs in the Southern Hemisphere\" conducted by the Republic of Korea. They use data from the KMTN Net Synoptic Survey of Southern Sky (KS4) to catalog nearly 72,000 candidates for detection of distant astronomical objects, of which only 0.4 percent are already confirmed. The authors suggest that future surveys will be necessary to discover more distant objects. They discuss the importance of finding unobscured sources of light in the cosmic scheme as they contribute to our understanding of \"both cosmic evolution and the mechanisms underly-ing the growth of SMBHs\" . Although there have been several surveys of distant stars in the northern hemisphere over the past two decades, the southern hemisphere remains relatively unexplored. In order to explore this promising area of the sky, the author's team applies statistical analysis to the KS4 data, using standard cosmological parameters such as H0 , H1 , H2 , and Zn -Î¼C . They then systematically filter the images from the survey to find the regions with the highest potential for discovery. To determine the sensitivity and range of the telescope, the authors use several different methods to estimate the effective survey area. They systematically filter the data by filtering by spectral type, resolving each image into its component parts using X-ray diffraction coefficients. They then perform a Bayesian analysis of the data to identify the sources that best fit their \"QSO\" classifications. They find that about a quarter of the images in the KS4 survey are actually QSOs, although this finding is only confirmed by indirect methods. To confirm the validity of their selection, they compare their QSO candi-dates with spectroscopic results from other surveys. The final product contains 72,964 sources, all of which meet the stringent criteria outlined in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. For verifying the quality of their data, they examine three different types of measurements: optical/near infrared, visible/infrared spectroscopy, and ground-based occultation. The authors consider these measurements as reliable until they get to the part of the spectrum where only a tiny fraction of the stars are visible. Next, they screen for brightness by considering only those objects that have been observed at least four times in every direction. Only those areas with more than four times the usual number of observations are left uncensored. Finally, they check the accuracy of their detection using an addi-tional signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 5 in the I-band. This step significantly reduces the overall number of sources. In order to distinguish between active galactic objects and inactive galactic objects, they use a technique called \"angle-searching,\" employing light-imaging techniques. They also employ a method called \"cri-teria . . . based on WISE colors.\" Indirect methods allow them to search for objects whose apparent brightness is less sensitive than that of visible or near-infrared light. Their statistical cutoff helps them to weed out false positives. The authors present their method for detecting \"low-redshift, unobscured\" QSOs in the sky using visible and near-infrared light. They note that their method outperforms previous methods for finding such objects due to its greater sensitivity and its ability to target distant objects at very high resolutions. They include in their calculations a systematic analysis of the observed data from three different telescopes, one on each side of the equator. They systematically rank the various telescope locations according to their effective area, or survey area, and then divide this area into four equal parts based on their respective strengths and weaknesses. Their goal is to find objects with a minimum effective area of less than 10 astronomical degrees. The authors perform several experiments to determine the sensitivity and resolution of theirQLSOs, as well as their overall performance. In order to make certain that they are correct to date, they check the accuracies of their measurements against previous work done by Yang & Shen, who have used optical-to-IR spectroscopy to search for stars in the Solstice Surveyor and the Miliquas catalog. Although their approach has some shortcomings, it offers a more complete view of the sky and thus a better opportunity to study distant objects. In this study, the authors present a catalog of unobscured QSO candidates matched to the KS4 catalog and our sample. Of the 38,534 candidates selected in both surveys, 23,593 were not selected by our selection criteria. Those rejected due to the lack of dithered observations we select Quaia candidates using the KS2 HeALPix maps, which cannot perfectly trace our survey area, es-pecially at the CCD gaps.
