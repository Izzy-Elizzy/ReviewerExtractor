We use SpitzerIRS mid-infrared spectra, high resolution CARMA 230 GHz continuum imaging, and 2-D radiative tr ansfer models to constrain the envelope structure, as well as the size and mass of the circum- protostellar disk in Serpens FIRS 1. The primary envelope parameters  are well constrained by the spectral energy distribution , including SpitzerIRAC and MIPS photometry, IRS spectra, and 1.1 mm Bolocam photometry. T hese together with the excel- lentuv-coverage  of multiple antenna conﬁgurations with CARMA allow for a robust separation of the envelope and a resolved disk. The SED of Serpens FIRS 1 is best ﬁt by an enve- lope with the density proﬁle of a rotating, collapsing spheroid with an in ner  radius of approximately 600 AU, and the millimeter data by a large resolved disk w ithMdisk∼1.0 M⊙and Rdisk∼300 AU. These results suggest that large, massive disks can be pre sent early in the main accretion phase. Results for the larger, unbiased sample of Class 0 sources in the Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus molecular clouds are needed to determine if relatively m assive disks are typical in the Class 0 stage. Subject headings: stars: formation — ISM: individual  – submillimeter – infrar ed: ISM Protostars build up their mass by accreting material from a dense protostellar envelope, presumably via a ro- tationally supported circum-protostellar accretion disk. Disk formation is a natural result of collapse in a ro- tating core, but it is not known how soon after pro- tostellar formation the disk appears, or how massive it is at early times. Theory suggests that centrifu- gally supported disks should start out small , and thus low mass, and grow with time cally supported disks, however, could be much larger The remnants of these protostellar accretion disks are easily observed in more evolved phases , but given that the majority of mass is accreted during earlier embedded phases, understanding disks at early times is critical. Directly observing disks during this main accretion phase is quite diﬃcult, however, as they are hidden within dense, extincting protostellar en- velopes. The structure of the envelope at small radii is another important characteristicof main accretion phase protostars that is similarly diﬃcult to directly observe. Disk growth or the presence of a binary companion may clear out the inner region of the envelope early on, as inferred for the binary Class 0 source IRAS 16293-2422 by . There has been a recent push toward detecting disksin more embedded objects, with many now known and roughly characterized in Class I protostars , and a few detected in the earlier Class 0 stage .1Most previous detailed studies have been lim- ited to the most well-known or brightest Class 0 sources, however, due to instrumental limitations and a lack of large unbiased target samples. The ongoing Submillime- ter Arraysurveyof low-massprotostars is a notable exception. With recent large surveys of nearby molecular clouds at mid-infrared and millimeter wavelengths it is now possible to deﬁne complete samples of Class limits . We have recently begun a campaign to characterize disk properties in a large, uniform sample of Class 0 protostars in nearby low mass star-forming regions  based on the bolometric temperature : Tbol≤70 K ; 70 K < Tbol≤650 K sume that classes correspond to an evolutionary sequence : in Class 0 the protostar has accrete d less than half its ﬁnal mass , in Class I M∗> Menv, and in Class II the envelope has dispersed, leaving only a circum -stellar disk.

Ourstudyisbasedon the complete  sample of uchus molecular clouds, identiﬁed by Enoch et al. by comparing large-scale SpitzerIRAC and MIPS and Bolocam 1.1 mm continuum surveys of the three clouds. Combining Spitzer IRS mid-infrared  spectra and high resolution CARMA 230 GHz continuum imag- ing with radiative transfer modeling of this sample will help to address several fundamental questions about the structure and evolution of the youngest protostars: 1) Howsoonafter the initial collapseofthe parentcoredoes a circum-protostellar disk form? 2) What fraction of the total circum-protostellar mass resides in the disk, and does this fraction vary with time? 3) Are large “holes” in the inner envelope, such as that found for IRAS 16293 by Jørgensen et al. , common at early times? MIR spectra and millimeter maps provide complemen- tary approaches to these questions. The amount of ﬂux escaping at λ/lessorsimilar50µm from deeply embedded sources is very sensitive to the opacity close to the protostar, and thus the envelope structure . While the MIR ﬂux is insensitive to disk properties, high resolution millimeter continuum mapping can directly detect emission from dust grains in the disk. Millimeter observations with excellent uv-coverage, combined with radiative transfer models, can separate the disk from the envelope and constrain the disk mass and size. Ourultimate goalisto characterizethe disk mass, size, and inner envelope structure of typical low-mass Class 0 protostars, and to quantify any trends with evolutionaryindicators. In this initial paper we present results for Serpens FIRS 1, a well known Class 0 source, which will serve as a test case for the full program. FIRS 1 is located at 18h29m49.6s+ 01o15′21.9′′ MolecularCloud. We adopt a distance of d= 260±10pc are scaled to this distance. It is a well know Class 0 protostar  ﬁrst noted in the far-infrared by Harvey, Wilking, & Joy , and also known by its sub-millimeter designation Serpens SMM 1 lar radio jet at the position of FIRS 1 , indicating a pow- erful outﬂow that is also clearly seen in molecular lines Figure 1 gives an overview of the FIRS 1 environment withSpitzer24µm and Bolocam 1.1 mm continuum maps of the Serpens main core. The nearest known YSO is approximately 25′′away, or 6000 AU in projected dis- tance , and the nearest embedded protostar known to have an envelope is 45′′≈11000 AU away . FIRS 1 is referred to as Ser-emb 6 in Enoch et al. core Ser-Bolo 23 . Based on 2MASS, Spitzer, and Bolocam data the bolometric luminosity is The Resolved Massive Disk in FIRS 1 3 Fig. 2.— SpitzerIRS spectrum of Serpens FIRS 1, using the Low Res 7 .4−14.5µm , Hi Res 9 .9−19.6µm , and Hi Res as diamonds; error bars represent the error in the mean for ea ch bin. Binned ﬂuxes are used in the model ﬁtting and given in T able 1. ing the Class 0 designation, and the total envelope mass is 8.0M⊙. Previous high resolution millimeter observations have placed limits on the mass of a compact disk in FIRS 1. Hogerheijde, van Dishoeck, & Salverda  used ob- servation from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory millimeter interferometer to estimate a total mass  within 100 AU of 0 .7 M⊙. Brown et al.  place a lower limit on the disk mass of∼0.1 M⊙with sub-millimeter observations  from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope- Caltech Submillimeter Observatory  single baseline interferometer. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph  on the Spitzer Space Telescope during 2007 Oc- tober 5 with the Low Res 7 .4−14.5µm , Hi Res 9 .9−19.6µm , and Hi Res times were 117 sec in SL1, 189 sec in SH, and 59 sec and ISO-LWS spectra  yield higher bolometric luminosities of 62 L ⊙and 95 L ⊙, respectively, but these may be confused with nearby embedde d protostars.in LH. Oﬀ-source or background spectra with the same integration times were also obtained for SH and LH. Spectra were extracted from the SSC pipeline ver- sion S16.1.0 BCD images using the reduction pipeline developed for the “From Molecular Cores to Planet-forming Disks” SpitzerLegacy Program optimal PSF extraction method of the pipeline, which is based on ﬁtting the analytical cross dispersion point spread function, plus extended emission, interpolating over bad pixels. The 1-D spectra are ﬂux calibrated us- ing a spectral response function derived from a suite of calibrator stars, corrected for instrumental fringe resid- uals, and an empirical order matching algorithm is ap- plied. PSF extraction was completed for both FIRS 1 and the background ﬁeld; the ﬁnal spectrum is the dif- ference between them. The resulting spectrum from 7 .4 to 37.2µm is shown in Figure 2. Each module is reduced separately, so the degree of agreement gives some idea of the reliability of calibration. Both the full reduced spectra , andtheaverageﬂuxinwavelengthbinsof∆ λ∼0.75µm, are shown. The SH spectrum has the lowest signal to noise, so it is binned on the coarsest grid. Only data with signal-to-noise greater than one  or three are included in the binned points. Binned ﬂuxes are listed in Table 1. In Figure 2 the silicate absorption band at 9 .7µm is clearly visible, and a hint of the CO 2ice band at 15 µm is also visible. A number of ﬁner features in the LH spectrum are most likely real, but will not be discussed here. Continuumobservationsat ν= 230GHz were completed with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy , a 15 element interferometerconsistingofnine 6.1m andsix10.4m an- tennas. Data were obtained in the B-array, C-array , D-array , and E-array  conﬁgurations between 2007 Oc- tober 24 and 2008 December 31. These data were com- bined to provide uv-coverage from 4 .5 to 500 kλ.

All three correlator bands were conﬁgured for contin- uum, 468MHzbandwidth, observations. Abrightquasar was observed approximately every 15 min- utes to be used for complex gain calibration. Absolute ﬂux calibration was accomplished using 5 minute obser- vations of Uranus, Neptune, or MWC 349. The over- all calibration uncertainty is approximately 20%, from the reproducibility of the phase calibrator ﬂux on nearby days. A passband calibrator, typically 3C454.3, was ob- servedfor15minutesduringeachsetofobservations,and radio pointing was performed every two hours. Observa- tions in the most extended B conﬁguration utilized the Paired Antenna Calibration System  to correct for phase variations on minute timescales . Calibration and imaging were accomplished with the MIRIAD data reduction package map of FIRS 1 is shown in Figure 3, with maps made at three resolutions: short baseline data only , all data, and long baseline data only . The direction of the 3.6 cm jet is shown for reference. The map including all data was inverted with natu- ral weighting, cleaned with a Steer CLEAN algorithm beam. The rms noise level in the central region is sian ﬁt are 0 .42 Jy beam−1and 1.38 Jy , and the deconvolved FWHM size is 1 .6′′×1.2′′. The synthesized beam corresponds to approximately 240 AU, while the longest baselines provide a resolution better than 100 AU . A gaussian ﬁt to the long baseline data yields PA= 25deg, approximately 75deg from the 3.6 cm jet axis . The extended, complex nature of the source is appar- ent, thanks to the excellent uv-coverage achieved with multiple conﬁgurations. Although it is diﬃcult to see the more extended envelope even in the short baseline map, it is clearly visible as an amplitude peak at uv-distances atuv-distances less than 4 kλ, corresponding to the sep- aration of the closest antenna pairs. Figure 4 shows that most of the source ﬂux is concentrated at low and in-TABLE 1 SpitzerIRS and broadband Spitzer, SHARC II, and Bolocam fluxes used in the SED fits Wavelength Flux Uncertainty Aperture Instrument Note. — Apertures in which ﬂuxes are calculated correspond to the instrument PSF, with the exception of the SHARC II and Bolocam ﬂuxes.

We also include in the observed SED the 350 µm con- tinuumﬂux,ob- tained with SHARC-II  at the CSO.

The amplitude bias, or expected value for zero signal, has been subtracted from the data. The SHARC-II ﬂux samples the peak of the SED, and helps constrain the long-wavelength side of the model SED. All ﬂuxes used in the SED ﬁt are given in Table 1, including uncertainties, aperture diameters and instru- ment used for the observations. To model the observed emission from FIRS 1, we use the two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC of Dullemond & Dominik . RADMC performs both Monte Carlo radiative transfer to derive the temperature distribution from an input density dis- tribution, and ray tracing to produce images and pho- tometry in speciﬁed apertures. We adopt a density pro- ﬁle very similar to that of Crapsi et al. , which includes three components: the envelope, the outﬂow cavity, and the disk. For both the envelope and disk we use the dust opacities from Table 1, column 5 of Ossenkopf & Henning  for dust grains with thin ice mantles, including scattering, interpolated onto the necessary wavelength grid. We note that although this is a young source, there could be signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the dust properties of the disk and envelope, as have been demonstrated in some Class I sources .The envelope density proﬁle is that of a rotating, col- lapsing sphere : ρenv =ρ0/parenleftbiggr Rc/parenrightbigg−1.5/parenleftbigg µ0/parenrightbigg−0.5/parenleftbiggµ µ0+2µ2 r/parenrightbigg−1 whereµ= cosθ,Rc=Rcentis the centrifugal radius, andρ0is the density at  = , which is set by the total envelope mass Menv= 8 M ⊙. A gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100 and mean molecular weight of 2.33 are included. Here µ0= cosθ0isthesolutionoftheparabolic motion of an infalling particle, given by: Rcent/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggµ0−µ µ0sin2µ0/parenrightbigg The model has no time dependence; Rcentis not a true centrifugal radius deﬁned by the conservation of angu- lar momentum during collapse, but simply a set radius wherethe density peaks, and inwardofwhich the density drops to very low values. The envelope outer radius Rout is the maximum value of the radial grid, so the envelope density is zero for r > R out. The outﬂow cavity is de- ﬁned by setting the density to zero in the region where cosθ0>cos. This results in a funnel-shaped cavity, which is conical only at large scales where Ang is the full opening angle. The disk density is given by a power law dependence in radius and a Gaussian dependence in height: ρdisk =Σ0√ Rdisk/parenrightbiggp1 exp/bracketleftBigg H/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg where Σ 0is set by the input disk mass Mdisk. At Rdiskp1 changes from −1 to−12, eﬀectively setting the disk radius. The scale-height variation  is given by: H =rp2. We set p2 = 2/7, corresponding to the self-irradiated passive disk of Chiang & Goldreich . Given that the disk is in large part hidden by the envelope, a much simpler description would likely work just as well, but we choose to follow the setup of Crapsi et al.  here. Most of the disk parameters are held ﬁxed for the main model grid, with only MdiskandRdiskvarying. Table 3 lists the range of input values for the model input parameters, some of which are held ﬁxed. The in- ternal luminosity is set by the bolometric luminosity; it is input to the model as the stellar luminosity, although most likely a majority of the luminosity is due to accre- tion. We do not include an interstellar radiation ﬁeld here, as the luminosity of any reasonable ﬁeld is negligi- ble compared to the internal luminosity of FIRS 1, and has only a negligible eﬀect on the long-wavelength SED. Small single parameter grids were run to test that model SED or millimeter visibilities. The scale height and ﬂaring  of the disk do aﬀect the 3 −20µm ﬂuxes, althoughonly for Incl <10deg, wherethere is too much NIR ﬂux to match the data regardless of the value of these parameters. A very puﬀy disk produces more emission in this range, while a very thin disk  produces less emission. Similarly, a ﬂared disk produces more MIR emission than one with no ﬂaring.

Stellar , envelope, and disk parameters are discussed in Section 4. To determine the best ﬁt envelope parameters we run a grid of models varying Rout,Rcent, Ang, and Incl. This results in a total of 588 envelope models, each observed at 13 inclination angles. A nominal disk of Mdisk= 0.01 M⊙,Rdisk= 150 AU is used for all en- velope models. A separate grid varying MdiskandRdisk with ﬁxedenvelopeparametersincludes 140models. Our tests show that the disk has little eﬀect on the SED for this source, making separate grids feasible. The model grids are compared to the SED and 230 GHz visibilities with a χ2analysis using data from Ta- bles 1 and 2. Contour plots of the resulting reduced χ2 are shown in Figure 5, where contours for both the SED and 230 GHz visibilities are plotted. The model and data visibilities are calculated by the same method, using vector averaging in radial annuli. The best-ﬁtting model  is compared to the data in Figure 6. The same envelope model with no disk is also shown for reference, as is an envelope model with no inner envelope hole . Determination of the best ﬁt model from Figure 5 is described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Due to the small uncertainties and the limited number of models, the reduced χ2values for even the best-ﬁt model are still fairly high . The bolometric tem- perature and luminosity of the best-ﬁt model are 35 .3 K and 17.3 L⊙. The bolometric luminosity diﬀers from the input stellar luminosity due to inclination eﬀects. While we only show the best-ﬁt model here, there is a rangeofvaluesforeachparameterthat canreasonablyﬁt the data, as determined by eye from χ2plots and visual inspection of the SED ﬁts. We ﬁnd that the envelope parameters have the following reasonableranges: Rout∼ and Incl ∼10−25deg. Reasonable disk parameters are Mdisk∼0.7−1.5 M⊙, andRdisk∼200−500 AU. Literature ﬂuxes are shown in comparison to our data and the best-ﬁt model SED in Figure 7. Shown are IRASHIRES 25, 60, and 100 µm from Hurt & Barsony, SCUBA 450 and 850 µm peak ﬂuxes from Davis et al. Casali et al. , and the OVRO 3 mm ﬂux from Testi & Sargent . They cannot be compared di- rectly to the model SED because many of them are peak ﬂuxes calculated in small apertures; circles show the corresponding model values computed in similar aper- tures. While there is not perfect agreement, the model is roughly consistent with the literature values, with the exception of IRAS ﬂuxes. The IRAS observations are lower resolution than the Spitzermaps, and FIRS 1 may be confused with nearby protostars . Lit- erature ﬂuxes are not included in the ˜ χ2ﬁtting. Envelope parameters are determined ﬁrst, using the grid of envelope models -). The 4-D ˜ χ2 space is collapsed along the parameters not plotted in each panel. We conclude below that Rout≤7000 AU based on the 230 GHz visibility ˜ χ2contours in panel in panels  and  to avoid complicating the plots With a few exceptions, the SED is much more sensi- tive to envelope parameters than are the 230 GHz visi- bilities.Rout, however, is only mildly constrained by the SED and is somewhat degenerate with Rcent. Increasing either parameterlowersthe total opacity of the envelope, allowing more MIR emission to escape. In addition, for Rout>7000 AU, the SED provides no constraint on Rcentbecause the opacity through the envelope is al- ready quite low. In this case, the 230 GHz data do help constrain the envelope parameters because visibility am- plitudes at uv-distance /lessorsimilar30kλtrace extended emission. A narrow peak in the uvplane  corresponds to a large envelope outer radius, and a wider peak to a small outer radius. The best compromise between the visibilities preferring smaller Routand the SED prefer- ring larger RoutisRout∼5000 AU . The Fig. 5.— Reduced χ2contours resulting from ﬁtting the observed SED and CARMA 23 0 GHz visibilities  to the grid of envelope and disk models. Models have been run for the full parameter ranges shown; the model grid resolution correspo nds to the axis labels , but the ˜ χ2distribution has been smoothed for a better visual represen tation. Contours from ﬁts to the both the SED  and visibilit ies  are show n, although envelope parameters  are primarily constraine d by the SED, while disk parameters  are constrained by the millimeter visibilities. In panels - the ˜ χ2distribution is collapsed along the parameters not plotted . The lowest contour plotted is ˜ χ2= 8. value of Rcentwith the lowest SED ˜ χ2in this case is A more compact envelope creates a high opacity to shorter wavelength emission, thus a larger Rcentis needed to decrease opacity close to the protostar and to match the observed NIR and MIR emission. For Rout≤7000AU,the rangeofreasonablecentrifugalradii areRcent= 400−700 AU. There are a few models with smallRcentand low ˜ χ2; when the viewing angle is just down the edge of the outﬂow  in a dense envelope . In these special cases the opacity is lowered just enough to give a similar emergent SED as models with a large inner envelope hole. A compact envelope with Rout∼5000 AU is consis- tent with the crowded star formation region in which FIRS 1 is located. The nearest embedded protostar that is known to have an envelope is 45′′, or approximately within a few arcminutes . While wedo not know the actual 3-D distances, envelopes with radiiRout∼5000 AU are certainly reasonable in this clustered region. Both the outﬂow opening angle and inclination are fairly narrowly constrained by the SED ,). There is a degeneracy between Ang and Incl; all models where the line of sight is directly within the outﬂow cavity  have very high ˜ χ2val- ues because they produce a large excess of NIR emis- sion. The SED is best ﬁt by models with low inclinations tinction in the MIR and cannot match the observed MIR ﬂux. Low inclinations may be in conﬂict with the orien- tation of the 3.6 cm jet, which has been interpreted as being almost in the plane of the sky based on proper mo- tion of emission knots in the jet . To summarize, the short uv-spacing visibility data fa- vor small outer radii, while the SED favors larger outer radii,withthebestcompromiselyingat Rout∼5000AU. The Resolved Massive Disk in FIRS 1 9 Fig. 6.— Best-ﬁt envelope and disk model, compared to the observed SE D  and 230 GHz visibilities . The SED includes t he binned IRS spectra and broadband data from 3 .6−1100µm . Three models are shown for comparison: the best- ﬁt envelope and disk , the best ﬁt envelope with no disk , and a mod el with no inner envelope hole . The envelope-only model  indicates the relative contributions of the envelope and d isk to the 230 GHz visibility amplitudes. ForRout= 5000 AU, the SED ˜ χ2is minimized for Rcent= 600 AU  of Figure 5). With Rcentset to 600 AU, it is straightforward to determine the best-ﬁt Ang and Incl from the SED χ2curves in panels  and None of the models accurately reproduce the shape of the silicate absorption feature or the slope of the spec- trum from 10 −20µm, although the uncertainties on the observed ﬂuxes are also quite high in this region. This is most likely a feature of the dust model and not the envelope density proﬁle. Similarly, the dust model does not include the 15 µm CO 2ice absorption feature. Note that the input stellar luminosity  is based on the bolometric luminosity calculated before the SHARC II 350 µm was available, and thus is lower than the bolometric luminosity of the best-ﬁtting model not change the results dramatically; the best-ﬁt centrifu- gal radius is a bit lower, 400 AU, without changing the other parameters. The reasonablerange of Rcentis much larger however, allowing for Rcentas low as 50 AU for larger outﬂow opening angles . After the envelope parameters have been determined, we run a separate grid in disk mass and radius with envelope parameters ﬁxed. The resulting ˜ χ2contours are shown in Figure 5 . Disk parameters are entirely constrained by the CARMA andRdisk. A quite massive and resolved  disk is required to ac-countforthe signiﬁcantﬂuxatintermediate uv-distances Typically, only a lower limit can be placed on the disk mass because once the disk emission becomes optically thick larger masses do not increase the millimeter ﬂux. Here, however, because the disk is resolved the mass is more tightly constrained. For FIRS 1, ﬁtting the visi- bilities out to maximum uv-distances from 50 −300 kλ produces the same best-ﬁt disk parameters, although the goodness of ﬁt increases with more data. The uv- coverage required to get a good ﬁt should depend on the disk and envelope structure. Disk properties derived by ﬁtting the 230 GHz visibil- ities are relatively insensitive to the assumed envelope parameters. It is true that a somewhat less massive disk would be required if there were no inner envelope hole; for example for Rcent= 50 AU, the best-ﬁt is for Mdisk∼0.4,Rdisk∼400 AU. However, for envelope pa- rameters with any reasonable ﬁt to the SED , Mdisk= 1.0 M⊙ andRdisk= 300 AU remain the best ﬁt to the 230 GHz visibilities. The disk mass is also reasonably robust to uncertain- ties in the envelope mass  and 230 GHz cali- bration. For Menv= 10 M ⊙the best-ﬁt disk is un- changed, because only the amplitude of the narrow peak at small uv-distances is aﬀected by the envelope mass. ForMenv= 6 M ⊙, a slightly larger, more massive disk for the decrease in envelope ﬂux at small uv distances. The overall ﬁt is poorer than for Menv= 8 M ⊙, however.

This serves both as a check on our derived envelope and disk parameters by indicating which con- clusions are dependent on the density model, and a test that our models give the most reasonable ﬁt to the data. Hogerheijde et al.  observed FIRS 1 with the OVROinterferometerat3.4,2.7,and1.4mm. Theyused a power law envelope model plus a point source, with the dust temperature power law set at −0.4 and ﬁxed in- ner and outer envelope radii of 100 and 8000 AU. These millimeter data were best ﬁt by an envelope with mass pointsourceofapproximately0 .7M⊙. Hogerheijde et al. notethattheyareunabletoseparatetheinneren- velope from any disk emission, and thus cannot place a meaningful limit on the disk itself. Compared to the Hogerheijde et al.  uv-coverage, 10 −180kλat the envelope , allowing us to separately model and remove the envelope contribution. Our data also have much higher signal-to-noise on long baselines Inadditiontotherotating, collapsingspheroid envelope models described in Section 4, we alsoran a small grid of models with a simple power law en- velope density proﬁle , plus a conical cavity. A steep power law, ρ∝r−2, provides a reasonable ﬁt to the visibilities without requiring a massive disk or large inner envelope hole. The best ﬁt is for Mdisk= 0.1 M⊙, Rdisk= 100 AU, and Rcent= 100 AU, as shown in Fig- ure 8. Here the emission at intermediate uv-distances is ﬁlled in by the envelope, which reaches high densi- ties close to the protostar, thus requiring less disk emis- sion. But, only a special combination of outﬂow opening angle and inclination can come close to matching the SED , and even the best-ﬁt model gives a much poorer ﬁt to the SED than the Ulrich models. In general, the power law models seem unable to reasonably ﬁt the NIR and MIR emission, although only p=−2 and−1.5 have been tested here. The ability of the power law envelope model to ﬁt the visibilities without a large disk is consistent with some previous studies that have found that disks are often not required to millimeter data of Class 0 and Class I sources that it is necessary to include both spectral and visibility data in order to ﬁt a consistent disk and envelope model. We use the online SED ﬁtting tool of Robitaille et al. as another estimate of the envelope parameters, although the 230 GHz visibilities cannot be included in the ﬁt. Robitaille et al.  use an envelope setup similar to ours, with the envelope infall rate ˙Menvset- ting the ﬁducial density ρ0. The best-ﬁt model corresponds to a protostar with age t= 2×105yr,M∗= 1.8 M⊙,R∗= 7 R ⊙, T∗= 4400K, envelope infall rate ˙Menv= 10−4M⊙yr−1, Rout= 11000 AU, Ang = 27deg, and Incl = 75deg. The total luminosity and envelope mass of this best ﬁt model are consistent with our values . Looking at the 10 best ﬁtting models, only the age perature , and envelope infall rate are reasonably well con- strained, while the other parameters cover a large range. We do not attempt to constrain the disk properties as the SED is relatively insensitive to the disk in embedded sources. In addition, we cannot use the online grid to constrain the envelope inner radius, because it is ﬁxed to the disk inner radius and very few models with both large envelope mass  and large inner envelope radius  are included in the grid. This diﬀer- ence in the inner envelope behavior likely accounts for the large outer radius and inclination required by the Robitaille et al.  models. Given our limited exploration of various models, we feel that the Ulrich envelope model provides the best description of the observed SED. While the derived disk parametersdo depend on the input envelope density pro- ﬁle, even in the most conservative case Mdisk/greaterorsimilar0.1 M⊙. Our derived disk mass of Mdisk∼1.0 M⊙within a ra- dius of 300 AU is consistent with the Brown et al. limit ofMdisk>0.1M⊙, aswell asthe Hogerheijde et al. limit of 0 .7 M⊙on the unresolved mass within The Resolved Massive Disk in FIRS 1 11 Fig. 8.— Best-ﬁt power law envelope model, ρ∝r−2, compared to the observed SED and 230 GHz visibilities. A ste ep power law alleviates the need for a massive disk , but the power law models are unable to m atch the observed MIR Spitzerﬂuxes. a radius of 100 AU. The early evolutionary state of FIRS 1 is conﬁrmed by the low bolometric temperature and the small disk-to-envelope mass ratio despite the high disk mass. Thus, our results suggest that large disks can accumulate very early in the protostellar collapse process. The FIRS 1 disk is likely too small to be considered a magnetically supported “pseudo-disk”. Given the ex- pected young age of FIRS 1, however, both the mass and radius derived here are much larger than expected for disk formation via gravitational collapse of a rotating core. Terebey et al.  predict that the disk radius, where centrifugal balance is achieved, should depend on the initial rotation Ω and isothermal sound speed csin the core as: Rd= 7/parenleftbiggcs AU. Based on the statistical relationship between Tboland time derived in Enoch et al.  , the bolometric temperature of FIRS 1 suggests that it has an age of 0 .7−0.8×105yr. For a reasonable sound speed,cs∼0.23 km s−1, this age and Rdisk= 300 AU requires an initial rotation rate of ap- proximately 5 ×10−13s−1. This value is higher than typical dense cores, which have Ω ∼10−13−10−14s−1 source is actually closer to 3 ×105yr, a more typical rotation rate would be suﬃcient for growing a 300 AU disk. Similarly, we can estimate how long it would take for the disk to build up 1 M ⊙via infall from the envelope. For an infall rate of ˙Menv∼c3 s/G∼10−5M⊙yr−1, andconservatively assuming that all of the infalling material falls onto the disk rather than directly onto the proto- star, accumulating 1 M ⊙would take 105yr. Although this is probably close to the age of FIRS 1, a disk of creted from the disk onto the star. Below we mention a few plausible methods for building up a large circum- protostellar disk in this object. A Class 0 lifetime longer than a few times 105yr, i.e., longer than the estimated timescale for Class 0 sources in nearby low mass star forming regions , wouldallowlargerdiskstogrow before the end of the Class 0 phase. FIRS 1 may have a higher envelope infall rate than average, allowing the disk to quickly accumulate mass. The bolometric luminosity of FIRS 1 is quite large compared to the typical luminosity of YSOs in nearby low-mass star forming regions . A luminosity of 11 L ⊙im- plies an accretion rate onto the protostar of at least envelope infall rate, Mdisk∼1 M⊙could easily be achieved in 0 .7−0.8×105yr. If the FIRS 1 disk has very low viscosity, mass may build up in the disk with very little accreting onto the protostar . Brown et al.  suggest that early disk for- mation and similar disk masses in the Class 0 and Class I phases could be achieved with a time-dependent viscos- ity, low at early times and higher by Class I. Perhapsmorelikely, this sourcecouldhaverecentlyen- teredaperiodofrelativelyrapidaccretion,asexpectedin the episodic accretion scenario . Such a high mask disk around a presumably low protostar mass should be unstable, and undergoing rapid accretion, ex- plaining the high luminosity. In this picture, the current high accretion phase would have been preceded by a pe- riod of low accretion onto the protostar while material built up in the disk . A larger sample is certainly needed to determine if such large, high mass disks are typical in the Class 0 phase. The recent Jørgensen et al.  study of 20 Class 0 and Class I sources ﬁnds disks masses in Class 0 from 0.01−0.5 M⊙, andMdisk/Menvratios of 1 −10%. If we calculate our disk mass by the same method as Jørgensen et al. , which uses the ﬂux at 50 k λ and assumes an optically thin, unresolved disk, we get Mdisk= 0.6 M⊙. While this is at the high end of the Jørgensen et al.  disk sample, the disk to envelope mass ratio  is con- sistent with their results, as is the idea that disks are already well established in the Class 0 stage. Regarding the envelope structure, it is important to keep in mind that while we refer to Rcentas the cen- trifugal radius, our model is not dynamical, and there is no dependence on rotation rate. Thus the sharp drop in density inside of this radius could have any number of causes, including acompanionthat hasclearedout mate- rial,aswellasrotationalcollapseontoadisk. Anybinary companion with a disk mass larger than 0.1 M ⊙should have been detected. There is a tentative second detec- tion 500 AU to the northwest of FIRS 1 ; the peak of approximately55 mJy would correspondto a disk mass of ∼0.06M⊙, but this may just be a “clumpy” feature in the envelope. The more likely explanation is that the inner envelope cavity is a result of collapse in a rotating core, and creation of the 300 AU radius disk. Alternatively, a clumpy envelope could cause a similar decrease in MIR opacity and might alleviate the need for an inner envelope hole . If the disk and envelope are physically connected, with both the disk and inner envelope hole governed by ro- tation in the collapsing core, we might expect Rdisk≈ Rcent. Althoughthebest-ﬁt Rcentisafactoroftwolarger thanRdiskhere, the range of reasonable values allow for Rcentto be as small as 400 AU and Rdiskto be as large as 500 AU. Thus, a physical continuity between the disk and envelope is certainly plausible. We utilize Spitzer IRS spectra, high resolution CARMA 230 GHz continuum data, and broadband pho- tometry together with a grid of radiative transfer models to characterize the disk and envelope structure of the Class 0 protostar Serpens FIRS 1. Our conclusions are: infrared spectra and millimeter data with excellent uv- coverage can reasonably constrain envelope parameters, includingtheinnerradius,outerradius,and outﬂow opening angle. In all cases there is a range of parameter values able to reasonably ﬁt the data. Oncethe envelope parameters have been determined, the mass and radius of the disk are robustly constrained by mil- limeter interferometry data with uv-coverage from <5 to>300kλ. velope, similar to IRAS 16293 . Unlike IRAS 16293, however, there is no strong evidence for a binary companion that might have cleared out the innerenvelope. Other explanationsfor sucha large Rcent in this source are:  collapse of the inner envelope onto the disk due to the conservation of angular momentum in a rotating, collapsing core, or  the Rcentdoes not indicate a true inner radius, but rather a “clumpy” enve- lope with much lower opacity in the MIR than a smooth envelope density proﬁle. CARMA 230 GHz visibilities require a quite massive, resolved disk. The best-ﬁtting disk has a mass of 1M ⊙, andaradiusofapproximately300AU.While this massis consistent with previous limits , it also indicates that protostars can accumulate relatively massive disks at very early times. This is somewhat at odds with theoretical expectations that disks start small and grow with time .

Similar modeling for an unbiased sample will allow us to char- acterize the typical disk mass, size, and inner envelope structure during the Class 0 phase. The authors thank the referee T.
