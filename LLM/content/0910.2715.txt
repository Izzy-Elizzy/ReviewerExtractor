Draft version November 6 2018
We present the rst results of a program to characterize the disk and envelope structure of typical
Class 0 protostars in nearby lowmass star forming regions We use SpitzerIRS midinfrared spectra
high resolution CARMA 230 GHz continuum imaging and 2D radiative tr ansfer models to constrain
the envelope structure as well as the size and mass of the circum protostellar disk in Serpens FIRS 1
The primary envelope parameters  are well constrained by the spectral energy distribution  including SpitzerIRAC and
MIPS photometry IRS spectra and 11 mm Bolocam photometry T hese together with the excel
lentuvcoverage  of multiple antenna congurations with CARMA allow for a robust
separation of the envelope and a resolved disk The SED of Serpens FIRS 1 is best t by an enve
lope with the density prole of a rotating collapsing spheroid with an in ner  radius of
approximately 600 AU and the millimeter data by a large resolved disk w ithMdisk10 Mand
Rdisk300 AU These results suggest that large massive disks can be pre sent early in the main
accretion phase Results for the larger unbiased sample of Class 0 sources in the Perseus Serpens
and Ophiuchus molecular clouds are needed to determine if relatively m assive disks are typical in the
Class 0 stage

Protostars build up their mass by accreting material
from a dense protostellar envelope presumably via a ro
tationally supported circumprotostellar accretion disk
Disk formation is a natural result of collapse in a ro
tating core but it is not known how soon after pro
tostellar formation the disk appears or how massive
it is at early times Theory suggests that centrifu
gally supported disks should start out small  and thus low mass and grow with time
cally supported disks however could be much larger
The remnants of these protostellar accretion disks are
easily observed in more evolved phases  but given that the majority of mass is accreted
during earlier embedded phases understanding disks at
early times is critical Directly observing disks during
this main accretion phase is quite dicult however as
they are hidden within dense extincting protostellar en
velopes The structure of the envelope at small radii is
another important characteristicof main accretion phase
protostars that is similarly dicult to directly observe
Disk growth or the presence of a binary companion may
clear out the inner region of the envelope early on as
inferred for the binary Class 0 source IRAS 162932422

There has been a recent push toward detecting disksin more embedded objects with many now known
and roughly characterized in Class I protostars  and a few detected
in the earlier Class 0 stage 1Most previous detailed studies have been lim
ited to the most wellknown or brightest Class 0 sources
however due to instrumental limitations and a lack of
large unbiased target samples The ongoing Submillime
ter Arraysurveyof lowmassprotostars is a notable exception
With recent large surveys of nearby molecular clouds
at midinfrared and millimeter wavelengths it is
now possible to dene complete samples of Class
limits 
We have recently begun a campaign to characterize
disk properties in a large uniform sample of Class 0
protostars in nearby low mass starforming regions  based on the bolometric temperature  Tbol70 K  70 K  Tbol650 K
sume that classes correspond to an evolutionary sequence  in Class 0 the protostar has accrete d less
than half its nal mass  in Class I M Menv and
in Class II the envelope has dispersed leaving only a circum stellar
disk

the complete  sample of
uchus molecular clouds identied by Enoch et al 
by comparing largescale SpitzerIRAC and MIPS and
Bolocam 11 mm continuum surveys of the three clouds
Combining Spitzer IRS midinfrared  spectra
and high resolution CARMA 230 GHz continuum imag
ing with radiative transfer modeling of this sample will
help to address several fundamental questions about the
structure and evolution of the youngest protostars 1
Howsoonafter the initial collapseofthe parentcoredoes
a circumprotostellar disk form 2 What fraction of the
total circumprotostellar mass resides in the disk and
does this fraction vary with time 3 Are large holes
in the inner envelope such as that found for IRAS 16293
by Jrgensen et al  common at early times
MIR spectra and millimeter maps provide complemen
tary approaches to these questions The amount of ux
escaping at lessorsimilar50m from deeply embedded sources is
very sensitive to the opacity close to the protostar and
thus the envelope structure 
While the MIR ux is insensitive to disk properties high
resolution millimeter continuum mapping can directly
detect emission from dust grains in the disk Millimeter
observations with excellent uvcoverage combined with
radiative transfer models can separate the disk from the
envelope and constrain the disk mass and size
Ourultimate goalisto characterizethe disk mass size
and inner envelope structure of typical lowmass Class 0
protostars and to quantify any trends with evolutionaryindicators In this initial paper we present results for
Serpens FIRS 1 a well known Class 0 source which will
serve as a test case for the full program

To model the observed emission from FIRS 1 we use
the twodimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
RADMC of Dullemond  Dominik  RADMC
performs both Monte Carlo radiative transfer to derive
the temperature distribution from an input density dis
tribution and ray tracing to produce images and pho
tometry in specied apertures We adopt a density pro
le very similar to that of Crapsi et al  which
includes three components the envelope the outow
cavity and the disk For both the envelope and disk
we use the dust opacities from Table 1 column 5 of
Ossenkopf  Henning  for dust grains with thin
ice mantles including scattering interpolated onto the
necessary wavelength grid We note that although this
is a young source there could be signicant dierence
in the dust properties of the disk and envelope as have
been demonstrated in some Class I sources The envelope density prole is that of a rotating col

To determine the best t envelope parameters we run
a grid of models varying RoutRcent Ang and Incl
This results in a total of 588 envelope models each
observed at 13 inclination angles A nominal disk of
Mdisk 001 MRdisk 150 AU is used for all en
velope models A separate grid varying MdiskandRdisk

tests show that the disk has little eect on the SED for
this source making separate grids feasible
The model grids are compared to the SED and 230
GHz visibilities with a 2analysis using data from Ta
bles 1 and 2 Contour plots of the resulting reduced 2
SED and 230 GHz visibilities are plotted The model
and data visibilities are calculated by the same method
using vector averaging in radial annuli
The besttting model  is compared to the data in Figure 6
The same envelope model with no disk is also shown for
reference as is an envelope model with no inner envelope
hole  Determination of the
best t model from Figure 5 is described in Sections 51
and 52 Due to the small uncertainties and the limited
number of models the reduced 2values for even the
bestt model are still fairly high  The bolometric tem
perature and luminosity of the bestt model are 35 3 K
and 173 L The bolometric luminosity diers from the
input stellar luminosity due to inclination eects
While we only show the bestt model here there is a
rangeofvaluesforeachparameterthat canreasonablyt

inspection of the SED ts We nd that the envelope

Envelope parameters are determined rst using the
grid of envelope models  The 4D  2
space is collapsed along the parameters not plotted in
each panel We conclude below that Rout7000 AU

With a few exceptions the SED is much more sensi

SED and is somewhat degenerate with Rcent Increasing
either parameterlowersthe total opacity of the envelope
allowing more MIR emission to escape In addition for
Rout7000 AU the SED provides no constraint on
Rcentbecause the opacity through the envelope is al
ready quite low In this case the 230 GHz data do help
constrain the envelope parameters because visibility am

A narrow peak in the uvplane  corresponds
to a large envelope outer radius and a wider peak to a
small outer radius The best compromise between the

Contours from ts to the both the SED  and visibilit ies  are show n although

value of Rcentwith the lowest SED  2in this case is
A more compact envelope creates a high opacity to
shorter wavelength emission thus a larger Rcentis
needed to decrease opacity close to the protostar and
to match the observed NIR and MIR emission For

areRcent 400700 AU There are a few models with
smallRcentand low  2 when the viewing angle is just
down the edge of the outow  in a dense
envelope  In these special cases the
opacity is lowered just enough to give a similar emergent
SED as models with a large inner envelope hole
A compact envelope with Rout5000 AU is consis
tent with the crowded star formation region in which
FIRS 1 is located The nearest embedded protostar that
is known to have an envelope is 45 or approximately
within a few arcminutes  While wedo not know the actual 3D distances envelopes with
radiiRout5000 AU are certainly reasonable in this
clustered region
Both the outow opening angle and inclination are
fairly narrowly constrained by the SED  There is a degeneracy between Ang and Incl
all models where the line of sight is directly within the
outow cavity  have very high  2val
ues because they produce a large excess of NIR emis
sion The SED is best t by models with low inclinations
tinction in the MIR and cannot match the observed MIR
ux Low inclinations may be in conict with the orien
tation of the 36 cm jet which has been interpreted as
being almost in the plane of the sky based on proper mo
tion of emission knots in the jet 
To summarize the short uvspacing visibility data fa

ForRout 5000 AU the SED  2is minimized for

Ang and Incl from the SED 2curves in panels  and
None of the models accurately reproduce the shape of
the silicate absorption feature or the slope of the spec
trum from 10 20m although the uncertainties on the
observed uxes are also quite high in this region This
is most likely a feature of the dust model and not the
envelope density prole Similarly the dust model does
not include the 15 m CO 2ice absorption feature
Note that the input stellar luminosity  is
based on the bolometric luminosity calculated before
the SHARC II 350 m was available and thus is lower
than the bolometric luminosity of the besttting model

gal radius is a bit lower 400 AU without changing the
other parameters The reasonablerange of Rcentis much
larger however allowing for Rcentas low as 50 AU for
larger outow opening angles 
After the envelope parameters 
have been determined we run a separate grid in disk
mass and radius with envelope parameters xed The
resulting  2contours are shown in Figure 5  Disk
parameters are entirely constrained by the CARMA
andRdisk A quite massive 
and resolved  disk is required to accountforthe signicantuxatintermediate uvdistances
Typically only a lower limit can be placed on the disk
mass because once the disk emission becomes optically
thick larger masses do not increase the millimeter ux
Here however because the disk is resolved the mass is
more tightly constrained For FIRS 1 tting the visi
bilities out to maximum uvdistances from 50 300 k
produces the same bestt disk parameters although
the goodness of t increases with more data The uv
coverage required to get a good t should depend on the
disk and envelope structure
Disk properties derived by tting the 230 GHz visibil
ities are relatively insensitive to the assumed envelope
parameters It is true that a somewhat less massive
disk would be required if there were no inner envelope
hole for example for Rcent 50 AU the bestt is for
Mdisk04Rdisk400 AU However for envelope pa
rameters with any reasonable t to the SED  Mdisk 10 M
andRdisk 300 AU remain the best t to the 230 GHz
visibilities
The disk mass is also reasonably robust to uncertain
ties in the envelope mass  and 230 GHz cali
bration For Menv 10 M the bestt disk is un
changed because only the amplitude of the narrow peak
at small uvdistances is aected by the envelope mass
ForMenv 6 M  a slightly larger more massive disk
for the decrease in envelope ux at small uv distances
The overall t is poorer than for Menv 8 M  however

Here we compare our models to other disk and enve
lope models This serves both as a check on our derived
envelope and disk parameters by indicating which con
clusions are dependent on the density model and a test
that our models give the most reasonable t to the data
Hogerheijde et al  observed FIRS 1 with the
OVROinterferometerat3427and14mm Theyused
a power law envelope model plus a point source with
the dust temperature power law set at 04 and xed in
ner and outer envelope radii of 100 and 8000 AU These
millimeter data were best t by an envelope with mass

meaningful limit on the disk itself Compared to the
Hogerheijde et al  uvcoverage 10 180kat

model and remove the envelope contribution Our data
also have much higher signaltonoise on long baselines
Inadditiontotherotating collapsingspheroid envelope models described in Section 4 we alsoran a small grid of models with a simple power law en
velope density prole  plus a conical cavity A
steep power law r2 provides a reasonable t to
the visibilities without requiring a massive disk or large
inner envelope hole The best t is for Mdisk 01 M
Rdisk 100 AU and Rcent 100 AU as shown in Fig
ure 8 Here the emission at intermediate uvdistances
is lled in by the envelope which reaches high densi
ties close to the protostar thus requiring less disk emis
sion But only a special combination of outow opening
angle and inclination can come close to matching the
SED  and even the bestt model gives a much poorer
t to the SED than the Ulrich models In general the
power law models seem unable to reasonably t the NIR
and MIR emission although only p2 and15 have
been tested here
The ability of the power law envelope model to t the
visibilities without a large disk is consistent with some
previous studies that have found that disks are often not
required to millimeter data of Class 0 and Class I sources
that it is necessary to include both spectral and visibility
data in order to t a consistent disk and envelope model
We use the online SED tting tool of Robitaille et al
although the 230 GHz visibilities cannot be included in
the t Robitaille et al  use an envelope setup

We do not attempt to constrain the disk properties as
the SED is relatively insensitive to the disk in embedded
sources In addition we cannot use the online grid to
constrain the envelope inner radius because it is xed
to the disk inner radius and very few models with both
large envelope mass  and large inner envelope
radius  are included in the grid This dier
ence in the inner envelope behavior likely accounts for
the large outer radius and inclination required by the
Robitaille et al  models
Given our limited exploration of various models we
feel that the Ulrich envelope model provides the best
description of the observed SED While the derived disk
parametersdo depend on the input envelope density pro

Our derived disk mass of Mdisk10 Mwithin a ra

a radius of 100 AU The early evolutionary state of
FIRS 1 is conrmed by the low bolometric temperature
our results suggest that large disks can accumulate very
early in the protostellar collapse process
The FIRS 1 disk is likely too small to be considered
a magnetically supported pseudodisk Given the ex
pected young age of FIRS 1 however both the mass
and radius derived here are much larger than expected
for disk formation via gravitational collapse of a rotating
core Terebey et al  predict that the disk radius
where centrifugal balance is achieved should depend on
the initial rotation  and isothermal sound speed csin

time derived in Enoch et al   the
bolometric temperature of FIRS 1 suggests that it has
an age of 0 708105yr For a reasonable sound
speedcs023 km s1 this age and
Rdisk 300 AU requires an initial rotation rate of ap
proximately 5 1013s1 This value is higher than
typical dense cores which have  10131014s1
source is actually closer to 3 105yr a more typical
rotation rate would be sucient for growing a 300 AU
disk
Similarly we can estimate how long it would take for
the disk to build up 1 M via infall from the envelope
For an infall rate of Menvc3
sG105Myr1 andconservatively assuming that all of the infalling material
falls onto the disk rather than directly onto the proto
star accumulating 1 M would take 105yr Although
this is probably close to the age of FIRS 1 a disk of
creted from the disk onto the star Below we mention
a few plausible methods for building up a large circum
protostellar disk in this object
A Class 0 lifetime longer than a few times 105yr ie
longer than the estimated timescale for Class 0 sources
in nearby low mass star forming regions  wouldallowlargerdiskstogrow
before the end of the Class 0 phase
FIRS 1 may have a higher envelope infall rate than
average allowing the disk to quickly accumulate mass
The bolometric luminosity of FIRS 1 is quite large
compared to the typical luminosity of YSOs in nearby
lowmass star forming regions  A luminosity of 11 L im
plies an accretion rate onto the protostar of at least
envelope infall rate Mdisk1 Mcould easily be
achieved in 0 708105yr
If the FIRS 1 disk has very low viscosity mass may
build up in the disk with very little accreting onto the
protostar  Brown et al  suggest that early disk for
mation and similar disk masses in the Class 0 and Class I
phases could be achieved with a timedependent viscos
ity low at early times and higher by Class I
Perhapsmorelikely this sourcecouldhaverecentlyen
teredaperiodofrelativelyrapidaccretionasexpectedin
the episodic accretion scenario  Such a
high mask disk around a presumably low protostar mass
should be unstable and undergoing rapid accretion ex
plaining the high luminosity In this picture the current
high accretion phase would have been preceded by a pe
riod of low accretion onto the protostar while material
built up in the disk 
A larger sample is certainly needed to determine if
such large high mass disks are typical in the Class 0
phase The recent Jrgensen et al  study of 20
Class 0 and Class I sources nds disks masses in Class 0
from 00105 M andMdiskMenvratios of 1 10
If we calculate our disk mass by the same method as
Jrgensen et al  which uses the ux at 50 k 
and assumes an optically thin unresolved disk we get
Mdisk 06 M While this is at the high end of the
Jrgensen et al  disk sample the disk to envelope
mass ratio  is con
sistent with their results as is the idea that disks are
already well established in the Class 0 stage
Regarding the envelope structure it is important to
keep in mind that while we refer to Rcentas the cen
trifugal radius our model is not dynamical and there
is no dependence on rotation rate Thus the sharp drop
in density inside of this radius could have any number of
causes including acompanionthat hasclearedout mate
rialaswellasrotationalcollapseontoadisk Anybinary
companion with a disk mass larger than 01 M should
have been detected There is a tentative second detec
tion 500 AU to the northwest of FIRS 1 
the peak of approximately55 mJy would correspondto a
disk mass of 006M but this may just be a clumpy
feature in the envelope The more likely explanation is
that the inner envelope cavity is a result of collapse in
a rotating core and creation of the 300 AU radius disk
Alternatively a clumpy envelope could cause a similar
decrease in MIR opacity and might alleviate the need for
an inner envelope hole 
If the disk and envelope are physically connected with
both the disk and inner envelope hole governed by ro
tation in the collapsing core we might expect Rdisk
Rcent Althoughthebestt Rcentisafactoroftwolarger
thanRdiskhere the range of reasonable values allow for
Rcentto be as small as 400 AU and Rdiskto be as large
as 500 AU Thus a physical continuity between the disk
and envelope is certainly plausible
We utilize Spitzer IRS spectra high resolution
CARMA 230 GHz continuum data and broadband pho
tometry together with a grid of radiative transfer models
to characterize the disk and envelope structure of the
Class 0 protostar Serpens FIRS 1 Our conclusions are
infrared spectra and millimeter data with excellent uv
coverage can reasonably constrain envelope parameters
includingtheinnerradiusouterradiusand
outow opening angle In all cases there is a range of
parameter values able to reasonably t the data Oncethe envelope parameters have been determined the mass
and radius of the disk are robustly constrained by mil
limeter interferometry data with uvcoverage from 5
to300k
velope similar to IRAS 16293 
Unlike IRAS 16293 however there is no strong evidence
for a binary companion that might have cleared out the
innerenvelope Other explanationsfor sucha large Rcent
in this source are  collapse of the inner envelope onto
the disk due to the conservation of angular momentum
in a rotating collapsing core or  the Rcentdoes not
indicate a true inner radius but rather a clumpy enve
lope with much lower opacity in the MIR than a smooth
envelope density prole
CARMA 230 GHz visibilities require a quite massive
resolved disk The besttting disk has a mass of 1M 
andaradiusofapproximately300AUWhile this massis
consistent with previous limits  it also indicates that protostars can
accumulate relatively massive disks at very early times
This is somewhat at odds with theoretical expectations
that disks start small and grow with time  Therangeofreasonabledisk andenvelopeparam
and inner envelope
using this method to characterize the disk and envelope
structure in a larger sample of Class 0 sources Similar
modeling for an unbiased sample will allow us to char
acterize the typical disk mass size and inner envelope
structure during the Class 0 phase
