Concerning recent published studies exploring the presence or otherwise of a gravi-
tational anomaly at low accelerations in wide binary stars as observed by the Gaia
satellite, Cookson  presents an interesting case. In that study, RMS values of
binned relative internal velocities in 1D for wide binaries are compared to Newtonian
predictions for that quantity, with the author concluding that the data presented show
no indication of any inconsistency with Newtonian expectations. However, the com-
parison presented is critically ﬂawed, as the Newtonian predictions used refer to wide
binaries with mean total masses of 2.0 M⊙. This is larger than the 1.56 M⊙value
which applies to the data used in said paper. In this short note we correct the error
mentioned above and show that the data and error bars as given in Cookson 
are in fact inconsistent with Newtonian expectations. Contrary to the assertion by
Cookson, the data presented in Cookson  actually show a clear anomaly in the
low acceleration gravitational regime, this being consistent with a number of indepen-
dent studies yielding this same result. Based on the analysis by Cookson , wide
binary systems show a clear Milgromian deviation from Newtonian dynamics.
Key words:
gravitation — stars: kinematics and dynamics — binaries: general —
Solar mass wide binary stars with separations above a few
thousand au probe the low acceleration regime, a ≲a0 =
tic and cosmological scales generally attributed to an as yet
undetected dark matter component occur. As ﬁrst proposed
by Hernandez et al. , the distribution of relative in-
ternal velocities between components of wide binaries will
hence provide a critical test of gravity at the same accel-
eration regime where at much larger scales dark matter is
invoked to force an agreement between observations and gen-
eral relativity  and Newtonian gravity. If wide binary
kinematics are found to be in accordance with Newtonian
predictions, then modiﬁed gravity proposals, which imply
deviations from Newtonian dynamics in the low acceleration
regime, would be strongly disfavoured. On the other hand,
if a gravitational anomaly is found in wide binaries, a low
acceleration validity limit for classical gravity will have been
found, removing any astrophysical justiﬁcation for the dark
matter hypothesis, and evidencing the need for the devel-
opment of extensions to GR. Notice that independent con-
straints on the local density of dark matter imply a limit
of ρDM < 0.01M⊙pc−3 , thus, any boost
at even tenths of a percent level detected in the relative ve-
locities of wide binaries at separations of order 6 kAU can
not be explained through invoking dark matter as currently
envisioned.
The release of the third Gaia catalogue has, for the ﬁrst
time, made available astrometric data of suﬃcient accuracy
to undertake wide binary gravity tests. As a consequence,
over the last couple of years a series of published studies
have appeared in this ﬁeld. Given the signiﬁcant potential
relevance of this test, all such works must be examined with
care. Two independent groups using various sample selec-
tion strategies and statistical test have published numerous
analysis showing consistent results for an accurate match to
Newtonian expectations in the high acceleration region for
separations below 2000 au where Newtonian gravity, and the
X. Hernandez, P. Kroupa
most well studied modiﬁed gravity theory of MOND , coincide. These studies include careful testing of
the methods applied using synthetic samples and a diligent
treatment of observational errors, which determine the con-
ﬁdence intervals of the reported results. Interestingly, these
studies also coincide in their results for the low acceleration
regime, but ﬁnding in this region a gravitational anomaly.
This consists of relative internal velocities between the com-
ponents of wide binaries with projected separations above
tions, in consistency with long standing MOND predictions.
Examples of the above are Hernandez , Chae ,
Hernandez et al. , Chae  and Chae .
A study concluding Gaia wide binaries show a 19σ pref-
erence for the best-ﬁt Newtonian model over the best-ﬁt
MOND one also appeared, Banik et al. . This last pa-
per however, suﬀers from several major ﬂaws, as recently
described extensively in Hernandez, Chae & Aguayo-Ortiz
at the regime transition found by the previous two groups,
both models being compared yield the same results as a self-
consistency check on the entire procedure. Also, Noise-free
models are compared directly to noisy data taken as a unique
observational template, in spite of the fact that the obser-
vational errors present are comparable, and in some cases
even larger, than the velocity binning used. Ignoring the full
eﬀects of observational noise explains the exaggerated con-
ﬁdence intervals quoted by the authors, and also introduces
a bias towards a Newtonian model.
The reason for this last point is that if one starts from
a MOND reality and then adds noise, the low velocity edge
of the velocity distribution will shift towards lower values
which are no longer accessible to noise-free MOND models.
Newtonian noise-free models on the other hand, are inher-
ently shifted towards smaller velocity values, and hence can
easily match the low velocity edge of a MOND reality which
includes the presence of observational noise. The opposite
does not happen on the high velocity edge of the velocity
distribution, because there the noise-free Newtonian models
of Banik et al.  easily match the MOND plus noise ex-
tension through the inclusion of ﬂybys and other kinematic
contaminants which the authors do not remove from the
sample, but attempt to account for in the 7-dimensional ﬁts
performed, where 6 of the 7 parameters refer not to gravity,
but to the various kinematic contaminants their sample was
not cleared of originally.
More recently Cookson  appeared, henceforth
Coo24, building on the approach of Hernandez, Cookson &
Cortes , and exploring the robustness of the results to
variations in one particular detail of the sample selection of
Hernandez, Cookson & Cortes . After testing several
options, the author settles on what he considers an optimal
data set, and presents it in comparison to Newtonian pre-
dictions, to conclude no gravitational anomaly is present in
the data. As it is easy to check, the conclusion is not only
invalid, but indeed the opposite, as the data in Coo24 were
compared to a Newtonian prediction calibrated for binary
stars having a mass of 2M⊙and not the 1.56M⊙which cor-
responds to the average mass of the binaries in the Coo24
sample.
In this short paper we expose this obvious mistake, and
show the same ﬁnal data form Coo24, but compared to the
Newtonian prediction corresponding to the correct normali-
sation. This shifts the Newtonian model downwards towards
slightly smaller velocities, to reveal the same low accelera-
tion gravitational anomaly reported by both the Hernandez
and the Chae groups. As a further consistency check, the
high acceleration results of Coo24 appear consistent with
Newtonian expectations once the correct normalisation is
included, while binaries with separations below 2000 au ap-
pear below the Newtonian predictions in the original Coo24
paper, a self-consistency check which was completely missed
by the author. Indeed, the Coo24 data show the robustness
of the results of the Hernandez group to the particular detail
being explored, and hence become a valuable conﬁrmation
of the wide binary gravitational anomaly.
The following sections probe into the Coo24 study in
detail, and make explicit the points mentioned above. Sec-
tion  discusses the variations in sample selection explored
in that paper, and Section  looks into the details of the
ﬂawed comparison presented against Newtonian predictions
for binaries having diﬀerent masses from the ones included in
the study, amongst other design ﬂaws of that paper. Section
COOKSON  SAMPLE SELECTION
With the stated aim of exploring the inﬂuence of selection
criteria on the conclusions drawn from wide binary grav-
ity tests, Coo24 constructs various wide binary samples and
compares their appearances on simple diagnostic internal
separation vs. velocity diagnostic plots. The sample selec-
tion is based on what was used in Hernandez, Cookson &
Cortes , allowing for modiﬁcations on one particular
parameter. The sample selection process begins with select-
ing all DR3 sources within a certain maximum distance, in
this case 143 pc, only marginally diﬀerent from the value
of 130 pc used in the publications of the Hernandez group.
To this ﬁrst sample only very lax quality cuts are imposed,
merely to have some conﬁdence in that the sources selected
are indeed stars. Then, a ﬁrst binary candidate list is pro-
duced by sampling 0.5 pc circles on the plane of the sky
about each star in search of potential companions. In the
works by the Hernandez group, and following the ideas of
El-Badry & Rix  and El-Badry et al. , this step
is optimised by requiring that any candidate pair satisﬁes
also that the distance between stars in the pair along the
line of sight lies  within a factor of
order 2 of the separation on the plane of the sky of the pair.
This last point was not included in the Coo24 study.
Next, comes the step which is explored in the Coo24 pa-
per, the removal of ambiguous candidate pairs. This, which
has been termed degrouping, consists of the removal of all
candidate pairs which include any star which is also a mem-
ber of any other candidate pair. At this point, an error toler-
ance must be speciﬁed on the maximum parallax error below
which a Gaia source will be considered as relevant for the de-
grouping process. In Hernandez, Cookson & Cotes, a value of
to the binaries studied was close to 100pc, and maximum
internal binary separations of 0.06 pc were considered, this
implies that noisier excluded sources will have 1σ conﬁdence

Figure 1. Left: The ﬁnal ﬁgure in Cookson . Each small black point represents a single wide binary, with the x-coordinate giving
the internal projected separation of the system, and the y-coordinate the 1D relative velocity between components of the binary. Each
binary appears twice, for RA and Dec measurements. The red and green points give binned RMS values for velocities in the various
sub-samples, for RA and Dec values, respectively, with the numbers above being the number of points per bin. The blue line gives the
Newtonian prediction for the 1D RMS binned values of Jiang & Tremaine , calibrated for an assumed total binary mass of 2M⊙.
Asides from the clear anomalous velocity bin labelled ’83’, which Cookson  for some unknown reason neglects to mention as such,
the low acceleration region to the right of 3000au, 0.015 pc, shows binned values which can be said to be consistent with the blue line, as
they lie only 1σ above it, bins labelled ’53’ and ’25’. The ﬁnal point to the right is of little relevance, both on account of its poor statistical
value, and because it contains binaries in a regime dominated by tidal eﬀects and stellar encounter interactions, which all other groups
working on the ﬁeld for good reasons avoid, see text. What the author failed to notice was that in the high acceleration region to the
left of 0.01 pc, which should serve as a consistency check of the overall procedure and a signal to any errors, the binned values actually
lie below the blue line. The ﬁgure hence apparently shows a hitherto unknown high acceleration gravitational anomaly where observed
binaries rotate under a suppressed eﬀective gravity. The reason for this lies in the fact that the average binary masses in the Cookson
the Newtonian prediction for binaries having the same mass as the average one present in the Cookson  sample . The
high acceleration region is now consistent with Newtonian predictions, and the low acceleration one shows again the clear close to 20%
velocity boost reported by the Hernandez and Chae groups, as evidenced by the solid red line of the MOND prediction. The slanted red
dashed line in both panels is a hand ﬁtted demarcation between bound binaries and ﬂyby cases appearing in the original.

with those of target stars, this is already at least 16.6 times
larger than the largest binary separations considered, and
hence refers to a source having a minimal probability of ac-
tually being a perturber of any kind. Coo24 explores the
eﬀects of relaxing this 1% maximum parallax tolerance for
the degrouping phase of the sample selection process.
Then, a series of quality cuts are applied to the data
to remove ﬂybys and cases where one or both stars in any
binary might be binaries themselves, through limits on the
allowed internal Gaia single-star solution RUWE quality in-
dex, requiring a radial velocity measurement to be available
for each star and that the diﬀerence in this quantity between
members of any binary be below 4 km s−1 and a ﬁnal ﬁl-
tering through the region of the HR diagram identiﬁed by
Belokurov et al.  and Penoyre et al.  to be least
aﬀected by unresolved binaries, which in this case would be
tertiaries. The details of the above quality cuts can be found
in Hernandez, Cookson & Cortes  or Coo24.
Coo24 repeats the entire sample selection and astrome-
try processing procedures for various values of the maximum
parallax tolerance error to be considered in the degrouping
phase, producing samples for 1, 1.4 and 2.5% tolerance er-
rors. The results are presented in plots showing the internal
projected separation of each ﬁnal binary considered against
the relative velocity between components of each binary,
both in RA and Dec. Coo24 settles for the 2.5% parallax
tolerance error during the degrouping phase as the optimal
choice for this parameter. Results appear in ﬁg. 6 of that
paper, which includes also a comparison against Newtonian
predictions from the work of Jiang & Tremaine , which
appear as a blue solid line in this ﬁgure. This line is then
compared against the RMS values of sub-samples binned
into internal separation intervals. We reproduce this ﬁgure
in the left panel of Fig. 1.
Coo24 uses this ﬁgure to conclude that Gaia wide bi-
naries show no indication of any low acceleration gravita-
tional anomaly, as most of the bins for separations larger
than 0.01pc appear broadly consistent with the Newtonian
line shown, with the exception of the one labelled ’83’, a
fact which for some reason Coo24 omits to mention. As it
is crucial to understand exactly how the blue line in ﬁg. 6
of Coo24 comes about, the following section explores this
point.

COOKSON  NEWTONIAN COMPARISON
In order to compare the points appearing in the diagnostic
plots of ﬁgs. 4-6 in Coo24 against Newtonian expectations,
the author presents binned RMS values at a number of in-
tervals. This is because the Newtonian expectation against
which the data are compared are the results of the study
by Jiang & Tremaine . This last study simulates large
populations of 50,000 wide binaries having a distribution of
ellipticities and random projection orientations, and evolved
through numerical simulations over a 10 Gyr period, in the
presence of the tidal ﬁeld of the Milky Way at the Solar Ra-
dius and encounters with molecular clouds. These binaries
are then projected on the plane of the sky and the resulting
distribution of points is ﬁnally summarised in their ﬁg. 7.
This ﬁgure gives binned RMS values of the relative 1D ve-
locity as a function of the internal projected separation on
the plane of the sky for the simulated binaries, precisely the
quantities given in ﬁgs. 4-6 of Cookson . However, ﬁg.

ues in km s−1 vs. internal binary projected separations in
pc from ﬁg. 7 in Jiang & Tremaine . This line in
dimensional units ﬁrst appeared in ﬁg. 4 of Hernandez et
al. . In the interest of keeping a constant comparison
line throughout the various publications by the Hernandez
group, the line was kept constant, assuming the same 2M⊙
total binary mass. This was always made explicit and borne
in mind when comparing to data, e.g., the 12th paragraph in
section  in Hernandez, Cookson & Cortes  makes
it explicit that a total binary mass of 2M⊙was assumed to-
wards arriving at the Newtonian comparison line for RMS
velocities shown in the ﬁgures where this appears in that
paper. Also, the ﬁfth paragraph in section  in Hernandez

nian expectation from the Jiang & Tremaine  results,
with comments on the change in normalisation between the
data and the line being important included in the seventh
paragraph of section  of that paper. That this line in di-
mensional form has remained invariant from Hernandez et
al.  to Coo24 is trivial to check, as it is also to per-
form the scaling directly from ﬁg. 7 in Jiang & Tremaine
ticular 2M⊙, to arrive at the blue line shown in ﬁgs. 4-6 of
Coo24.
The average binary mass in Hernandez  was of
in Coo24, the average binary mass in that work is also of
that the comparison presented in ﬁg. 6 in Coo24 is critically
ﬂawed. Before correcting this obvious mistake, the original
ﬁg. 6 in Coo24 deserves a closer look, as shown in the left
panel of our Fig.1. The claim of no gravitational anomaly
in the 2D projected separation > 0.01 pc region, even when
comparing against Newtonian expectations for masses larger
than the ones present, is somewhat suspect, not only because
the ’83’ bin shows a clear velocity boost well above the 1σ
conﬁdence interval given in the ﬁgure for that bin, but also
because the following two bins appear above the Newtonian
line, although only at a 1σ level. The ﬁnal bin, containing
only 6 binaries is irrelevant, not only on account of the clear
lack of statistical signiﬁcance at such low occupancy num-
bers, but also because of the enormous projected separations
covered. Of the other groups having published on the topic,
in both the Chae publications and in Banik et al.  the
samples are ended at 0.15pc, Pittordis & Sutherland 
stop at 0.1 pc, and, over an abundance of caution, in the
Hernandez group publications the samples end at 0.06 pc.
It is clear that observed projected separations are only lower
limits on the present 3D separation between the components
of observed binaries, which in turn, given the elliptical or-
bits these systems present , are only
lower limits to the maximum orbital separations attained
by a given binary. Given the average interstellar separation
of close to 1 pc for stars in the Solar Neighbourhood, all the
groups listed above have chosen to stop the analysis well be-
fore the maximum projected separation of 0.5pc considered
in Coo24, to minimise the presence of nearby perturbers.
A ﬁnal important point to note regarding the original
ﬁg. 6 in Coo24, is the failure of the high acceleration con-
sistency check. The inclusion of a Newtonian region where
there is no uncertainty as to what the result should be is
intended as an internal check on the whole procedure. How-
ever, as can be checked in the left panel in our Fig. 1, the
binned RMS values of high acceleration binaries with sep-
arations below 0.01 pc actually appear as sub-Newtonian.
The original data presented in Coo24 actually show a clear
gravitational anomaly for high acceleration binaries show-
ing smaller relative velocities than Newtonian expectations.
Clearly, this should have alerted the author to the presence
of an error in the comparison, the mass normalisation mis-
match noted above.
Finally, we reproduce in the right panel of Fig.1 the
exact same data of the ﬁnal ﬁg. 6 in Coo24, but adjusting
the Newtonian prediction to match the average total binary
mass of 1.56M⊙present in the Coo24 sample. As can be
seen, the high acceleration region for separations below 0.01
pc is now accurately consistent with the Newtonian predic-
tion, with the exception of the tightest bin, where edge ef-
fects lead to a small oﬀset. The low acceleration region with
separations above 0.01 pc on the other hand, now clearly
shows a gravitational anomaly consistent with the 20% ve-
locity enhancement of MOND expectations, shown by the
solid red line. At separations larger than 0.01 pc, the bins
labelled ’132’, ’53’, ’25’, and even the highly suspect last
Newtonian prediction, and in excellent accordance with the
MOND prediction of the red line. The ’83’ bin is also incon-
sistent with Newtonian expectations, but remains anoma-
lous when compared to the MOND predictions, although by
a smaller amount than what appears in the original Fig.6 in
Coo24. Going beyond this ﬁrst qualitative comparison would
require a detailed statistical comparison against full velocity
distribution predictions, of the type presented in e.g. Chae

nandez and the Chae groups are dismissed on the basis of
the mistaken diagnostic comparison we reproduce in the left

panel of Fig. 1, without including any detailed statistical
test of the type appearing in e.g. Hernandez et al.  or
in any of the publications of the Chae group, where careful
comparisons of the full velocity distributions against sim-
ulated full velocity distributions of Newtonian models are
performed. Indeed, the sample selection parameter explored
in Coo24 is not even of any relevance for the publications of
the Chae group, where the isolation of ﬁnally selected bina-
ries is guaranteed through completely independent mecha-
nisms. As is evident from the right panel of our Fig. 1, what
the results of Coo24 in fact show is exactly the same low ac-
celeration gravitational anomaly which has been reported in
numerous independent analysis of the Hernandez and Chae
groups, e.g. see ﬁg. A1 in Hernandez  or ﬁg. 13 in
Chae .
We have show that the study by Cookson  suﬀers from
a critical ﬂaw which renders its conclusions void. Correcting
the mistake in question, and using the data presented in that
paper, in fact reveals a clear gravitational anomaly at low ac-
celerations, with relative velocities between the components
of observed binary stars being above Newtonian expecta-
tions. Thus, the data presented in Cookson  are in fact
consistent with recent studies showing a close to 20% veloc-
ity boost for Gaia binaries with separations beyond 3000 au,
e.g. Hernandez et al. , Chae , Hernandez et al.
generic MOND predictions of decades ago.
