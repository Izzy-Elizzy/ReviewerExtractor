From Gas Giants to Sub-Neptunes

A primary goal of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres is to constrain planetary bulk properties,
such as their metallicity, C/O ratio, and intrinsic heat. However, there are significant uncertainties in
many aspects of atmospheric physics, such as the strength of vertical mixing. Here we use PICASO and
the photochem model to explore how atmospheric chemistry is influenced by planetary properties like
metallicity, C/O ratio, Tint, Teq, and Kzz in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We vary the Teq of the
planets between 400 K- 1600 K, across “cold”,“warm,” and ‘hot” objects. We also explore an extensive
range of Tint values between 30-500 K, representing sub-Neptunes to massive gas giants. We find that
gases like CO and CO2 show a drastically different dependence on Kzz and C/O for planets with cold
interiors  compared to planets with hotter interiors ,
for the same Teq. We also find that gases like CS and CS2 can carry a significant portion of the S-
inventory in the upper atmosphere near Teq ≤600 K, below which SO2 ceases to be abundant. For
solar C/O, we show that the CO/CH4 ratio in the upper atmospheres of planets can become ≤1 for
planets with low Teq, but only if their interiors are cold . We find that photochemical haze
precursor molecules in the upper atmosphere show very complex dependence on C/O, Kzz, Teq, and
Tint for planets with cold interiors . We also briefly explore fully coupling PICASO
and photochem to generate self-consistent radiative-convective-photochemical-equilibrium models.
Major goals of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres
are to understand the formation and evolutionary his-
tory of planets.
This process involves observing exo-
planetary atmospheres and intrepreting these observa-
tions to estimate some key bulk planetary parameters,
like metal enrichment of the atmosphere, which can be
used to understand their formation scenario and evolu-
tionary history. However, our interpretation of observa-
tional data of exoplanetary atmospheres requires a ro-
bust understanding of the various physical and chemical
processes ongoing in the planet’s atmosphere. In this
work, we explore how a series of atmospheric processes
can affect our interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric
observations. We explore how these atmospheric pro-

cesses specifically impact atmospheric chemistry, which
is a crucial link between understanding exoplanetary at-
mospheres and constraining their formation and evolu-
tionary processes.
There has been a considerable amount of modeling
work revolving around the idea that planets retain some
amount of information about their formation scenario
and subsequent evolution in their current state .
This information can be retained within im-
portant planetary parameters like the planetary radius,
bulk metal enrichment, elemental abundance ratios, in-
ternal heat flux of the planet, etc. .
For transiting planets, parameters like
planetary mass and radius are directly measurable. But
other critical parameters like bulk metal-enrichment,
bulk elemental abundance ratios, and internal heat flux

of planets need to be inferred by observing and under-
standing their atmospheres. As planetary atmospheres
are quite complex, drawing inferences about their bulk
properties requires a detailed understanding of the mul-
tiple interconnected physical processes at play.
JWST observations have opened a new era of precision
chemical analysis of transiting planet atmospheres .
This is especially interesting because the atmospheric
chemistry of planets with H/He atmospheres  is sensitive to three
key planetary parameters – 1) bulk metal-enrichment , 2) bulk elemental abundance ratios, and 3)
internal heat flux of planets .
The metallicity of a planet’s atmosphere is defined as
planet/sun, where X represents the number
of atoms of a certain element  in the
object and H is the number of hydrogen atoms. There-
fore a planet with higher metallicity will have signifi-
cantly different atmospheric chemical composition than
one with lower metallicity. Two planets with the same
metallicity might have the “metals” distributed differ-
ently among various elements. For example, one planet
can have a higher C/H ratio and lower O/H ratio than
the other and yet maintain the same bulk metallicity
abundance ratios are important potential markers of the
formation location of planets because of the presence
of various ice lines in propoplanetary disks . It
is clear and well-studied how both of these bulk parame-
ters can affect atmospheric chemistry especially if the at-
mosphere is in thermochemical equilibrium throughout
planets and brown dwarf atmospheres have shown that
disequilibrium chemical processes in addition to ther-
mochemistry can play a significant role across planetary
atmospheres .
The chemical structure of a planet’s atmosphere is
shaped by a number of other physical processes too,
namely – 1) atmospheric mixing, 2) photochemistry, 3)
condensation, and 4) molecular diffusion. As a result,
the photospheric abundance of a gas like CH4 is not only
controlled by the metallicity, C/O ratio, and heat flux
from the deep interior of the planet but also by parame-
ters like the stellar UV flux incident on the planet along
with atmospheric properties like strength of vertical and
horizontal dynamics in the atmosphere . Molecular diffusion is an important pro-
cess controlling the chemical nature of atmospheres at
very low pressures but the importance of this process
is often overshadowed by photochemical processes, es-
pecially in highly irradiated giant exoplanets . Atmospheric mixing, photochemistry, con-
densation, and internal heat flux of exoplanets remain
the least understood/constrained processes/parameters
in exoplanet atmospheres. We briefly explain these pro-
cesses here.
Atmospheric Mixing – Atmospheres of planets are dy-
namic, not static, in nature. This dynamics can play out
in three dimensions causing both vertical and horizon-
tal bulk transport of gases and aerosols in atmospheres
photospheric abundances of gases such as CH4, CO, NH3
can be significantly altered depending on the strength of
dynamics in the atmosphere . 3D models of tidally
locked close-in giant exoplanets have revealed three ma-
jor types of transport operational in their atmospheres
gases and aerosols from the deeper parts of the atmo-
sphere across several pressure scale-heights, while the
day-to-night winds can transport gases from the hot-
ter day-side of the planet to their colder night-side.
Clearly, a full understanding of the role of atmospheric
dynamics on planet-wide chemistry requires the use of
sional parameter space involved. This vast parameter
space includes dimensions like the stellar flux incident
on the planet, the planet’s gravity, atmospheric com-
position, rotational period, interior properties such as
interior heat flux, cloud composition, etc. The compu-
tational run times involved in 3D atmospheric models
often prohibit a full scale parameter space exploration.
However, 1D models can somewhat capture the verti-
cal transport operating in these atmospheres by simpli-
fying the transport as a diffusive process, parametrized
with the 1D eddy diffusion coefficient– Kzz.
Kzz is
defined as vmixLmix, where vmix is the typical veloc-
ity of transport and Lmix is the typical length-scale at
which this bulk transport is operational . But, observational constraints on Kzz are very
weak.
Recently, several studies have constrained Kzz
to a certain extent in brown dwarf atmospheres with
ground-based and space-based data  but we have only started to constrain it for irradi-
ated planets . Various 3D and 2D modeling
efforts have found a large range of Kzz values in model
atmospheres , keeping the parameter uncertain by sev-
eral orders of magnitude in irradiated planets. It is im-
portant to especially mitigate this uncertainty due to
the influence of Kzz on key gas abundances that are
used to infer bulk properties of planets such as C/O or
metallicity.
Internal Heat Flux – As planets evolve, they slowly
lose their gravitational heat of formation to space. This
energy is carried from the deep interior through convec-
tion to the deep atmosphere up to the point where the
atmosphere is opaque at all wavelengths . Beyond that, the heat is lost to space via
radiation in the partially or fully optically thin radia-
tive atmosphere. Therefore, detailed properties of the
atmosphere, such as its composition and thermal struc-
ture, control the rate of cooling of the whole planet over
its entire lifetime.
This rate of cooling, in turn, also
controls the contraction of the planet over time. Addi-
tionally, external energy sources like tidal heating can
also deposit energy to the deep interior of the planet,
the extent of which depends on various orbital and bulk
planet properties.
The internal heat flux cannot be measured directly
through transmission and emission spectroscopy of
close-in exoplanet atmospheres because it typically only
alters the temperature structure of the planet where its
atmosphere is optically thick, leading to little or no af-
fect on its photospheric temperatures. However, internal
heat flux can indirectly affect the photospheric chemi-
cal abundances due to the vertical mixing phenomenon
discussed previously . If gases are mixed up to the photospheres
of the planets from the deep optically thick atmosphere,
where internal heat flux affects chemistry, then they can
alter the observable photospheric chemistry of the planet
and let us infer the internal heat flux of the planet as
well. This works for gases which are stable for long times
and not chemically destroyed in the photosphere imme-
diately after being transported. Gases such as CO and
N2 fit into this category as destroying them chemically
at low temperature photospheres and converting them to
gases like CH4 and NH3 is generally energetically pro-
hibitive.
Therefore, photospheric abundances of such
gases are strongly influenced by the internal heat flux of
the planet. Recently, JWST transmission spectroscopy
observations of WASP-107b were used to constrain its
internal heat flux by Welbanks et al.  and Sing
et al. . Both of these analysis revealed a high Tint
heating of the planet’s interior. Similar constraints on
other transiting planets have also been obtained using
HST . These studies are an excel-
lent example of how understanding atmospheric chem-
istry can reveal details of close-in giant planet evolution.
The internal heat flux of a planet at a given age de-
pends on the mass of the planet.
For example, at a
similar age, a more massive planet is expected to have
a hotter interior than a less massive planet, if there are
no external perturbations on the planet such as tidal
heating.
However, interior temperatures also depend
on aspects of atmospheric physics.
For example, the
strength of vertical mixing plays a major role in affect-
ing both atmospheric clouds and chemistry.
Both of
these things can delay/accelerate the cooling of planets
over time .
Photochemistry – Planets can have significant X-ray
and UV photons incident on them from their host
stars. These photons can cause the photolysis of weakly
bonded molecules such as CH4, NH3, H2S, etc. in the
upper atmosphere . This can trigger a whole new
set of chemical reactions altering photospheric compo-
sition. The first concrete evidence of a photochemical
by-product was confirmed with JWST in WASP-39b by
the presence of photochemically produced SO2 in its up-
per atmosphere . While
significant modeling work on understanding photochem-
istry in close-in planets has been done previously , this JWST
work demonstrated that photochemistry cannot be ne-
glected while modeling the photospheric chemical na-
ture of planets and using abundances to infer planetary
properties.
Additionally, photolysis of gases like CH4 and NH3
can lead to the production of C- and N- bearing
molecules like C2H2 and HCN. These gases in the up-
per atmospheres of H2/He-rich atmospheres can act as
precursors for further reactions to form photochemical
hazes . The optical properties of these hazes
are such that they can play a significant role in shaping
the observable spectra of exoplanet atmospheres .
The discussion above shows that the observational
data from transiting planets today is at a stage where
its chemistry can be leveraged to not only understand
atmospheric elemental compositions of planets but also
should be leveraged to understand exoplanetary atmo-
spheric processes better as well.
These include con-
straining key atmospheric processes such as atmospheric
dynamics and parameters like internal heat flux of plan-
ets.
Therefore, it is necessary to explore how atmo-
spheric dynamics and internal heat flux can influence
the photospheric abundance of gasses in exoplanets with
varying bulk properties such as equilibrium tempera-
ture, C/O ratio, metallicity, and varying amounts of
incident UV flux. It is also important to identify the
key molecules that can produce the best constraints on
very uncertain parameters like Kzz in different parts of
this vast parameter space.
This paper presents a broad parameter space study
to address these questions. Our work is applicable to a
wide variety of planets. In terms of internal heat flux,
this includes sub-Neptune mass planets with lower inter-
nal heat fluxes, to Jupiter mass giant planets with much
hotter interiors. In terms of planetary temperatures, we
explore planets between cold giant planets 
to hot Jupiters . We also explore the at-
mospheric chemistry of planets with varying C- and O-
abundances. We also investigate the effects of a wide
range of the atmospheric mixing parameter Kzz and at-
mospheric metallicity on the chemistry of these planets.
We describe our modeling setup in§2 followed by the
results presented in §3. We discuss the limitations and
caveats in this analysis in §4 followed by summarizing
our key conclusions in §5.
The aim of the modeling presented in this work is
to explore a significant parameter space of properties
that can influence atmospheric chemistry of transit-
ing planets with H/He atmospheres.
The parameters
we consider in this study are the equilibrium temper-
ature , interior heat flux through the parameter
Tint, strength of vertical mixing parameterized with
Kzz, C/O ratio, and metallicity. The modeling setup
to achieve this parameter space exploration can be di-
vided into two different components – 1) 1D radiative–
convective atmospheric modeling, and 2) chemical ki-
netics modeling. We describe each component in detail
below.
We use the 1D radiative–convective equilibrium model
PICASO  to
generate atmospheric temperature–pressure ) pro-
files for irradiated planets. We generate the T pro-
files for a planet with gravity= 4.5 ms−2 around a star
with Teff=5327 K, log=4.38, = -0.03, and Ra-
dius= 0.932 R⊙. These system parameters are chosen
to be the same as WASP-39b. We divide the planet at-
mosphere into 91 plane-parallel levels  loga-
rithmically spaced in pressure between 10−6 to 100/5000
bars. We generate the T profiles using the heat re-
circulation factor rfacv= 0.5, which corresponds to the
case of full heat redistribution across the planet.
place the planet at different distances from the star such
that the Teq of the planet  are 1600
K, 1400 K, 1100 K, 900 K, 800 K, 600 K, and 400 K. For
each of these cases, we generate 5 different cases with dif-
ferent Tint values of 30 K, 100 K, 200 K, 300 K, and 500
K. The lowest value, 30 K, is representative of Gyr+ old
sub-Neptunes . Jupiter’s value
today is 100 K. More massive, younger, or inflated gas
giants  would
have larger Tint values . The equi-
librium chemistry calculation and gaseous opacities used
for computing these T profiles are the same as used
in Mukherjee et al. . Figure 1 shows these gen-
erated T profiles where each panel corresponds to a
different Teq case. Note that these radiative–convective–
thermochemical–equilibrium  models were cal-
culated by including TiO and VO opacities, which are
known to cause thermal inversions in atmospheres which
have Teq≥1600 K. We generate these T profiles at
librium throughout the atmosphere.
To simulate disequilibrium chemistry within our
model atmospheres, we use the python wrapped Pho-

six panels correspond to Teq= 1600 K, 1400 K, 1100 K, 900 K, 800 K, and 600 K. The kink at 1 mbar and 1700 K in the hottest
models  is due to a small amount of TiO opacity. All the T profiles have been computed for a planet with

tochem1 chemical kinetics model .
We use the T profiles computed using the
method described in the previous section as inputs in
the Photochem package. In addition to the Photochem
package, we use the Cantera software  to simulate thermochemical equilibrium in the
very deep atmosphere of the model planet atmospheres.
For each model, we use the quench time approxima-
tion with chemical timescales from Zahnle & Marley
like CH4, NH3, CO2, etc. At atmospheric levels with
pressures much greater than the highest quench pres-
sures among these gases , we use Cantera to
calculate the thermochemical equilibrium state of the at-
mospheres. At pressures smaller than this pressure level
we use Photochem to simulate chemical disequilibrium
with its kinetics calculations.
The convergence crite-
ria used in our photochemistry modeling is presented in
tochemical models significantly quicker than using the
chemical kinetics calculation for all the pressure layers
in the atmosphere including the very high pressure and
high temperature deep atmosphere where chemical reac-
tions are expected to be very fast. The setup saves com-
putational time by preventing the kinetics model from
taking extremely small time steps to model the very
rapid chemical reactions in the very deep atmosphere,
which is bound to remain in thermochemical equilib-
rium anyway. To maintain sufficient accuracy in the 1D
chemical kinetics calculations, we interpolate the atmo-
spheric T profiles with 91 pressure levels to a finer
grid of pressures with 180 pressure levels before ingest-
ing them within Photochem.
For a given metallicity, we scale the C/H, O/H, N/H,
S/H from the solar values with the metallicity factor
in our model.
To change the C/O ratio for a given
metallicity, we change both the C/H and O/H such that
tain the same atmospheric metallicity while changing
the C/O ratio of the atmosphere.
To account for O-
atoms locked up in various expected condensates such
as silicates, we remove 20% of the O from the atmo-
spheric gas phase.

T profiles computed assuming radiative–convective–thermochemical equilibrium  and radiative–
convective–photochemical equilibrium  are shown with dashed black lines and solid red lines, respectively. The assumed
Teq, , and C/O of the model is 800 K, +1.0, and 1×solar, respectively. Each panel corresponds to a different Tint from
and brown, respectively. The dashed VMR profiles are from the RCTE models whereas the solid VMR profiles correspond to
the RCPE models. The narrower panel accompanying each of the four panels shows the different in the T profile between
the two modeling assumptions in each case as a function of pressure.
PICASO and Photochem can be fully and iteratively

the difference in the T profile between a fully self-
consistent treatment of photochemistry within the cli-
mate model and a profile computed assuming radiative–

Teq=
K,
and C/O=1×solar.
The radiative–
convective–photochemical equilibrium   model was
computed by combining the Photochem kinetics model
mate calculation framework.
Each panel of Figure 2
illustrates the difference between the T profiles for
four different Tint values of 100 K, 200 K, 300 K, and
RCPE  chemical profiles for CH4 , NH3
It is clear that for lower values of Tint, the maximum
difference in the T profile is typically around ∼100
K in the 0.1 mbar to 0.1 bar range.
Whereas as the
Tint increases, small differences of the order of ∼20
K remain in the profiles, even at deeper pressures till
around 100 bars.
This shows that the corrections in
the T profiles due to radiative feedback from the
changed atmospheric chemistry due to vertical mixing
or photochemistry is an important effect, especially for
high Tint values. This will be especially relevant for in-
terpreting emission spectra of planets. Even though this
work focuses on modeling disequilibrium chemistry ef-
fects, we choose not to use the RCPE approach for our
T profile calculations mainly because this can vastly
increase the computational time involved in running a
transmission spectroscopy in this paper where temper-
ature has a relatively small effect compared to emission
spectroscopy. Moreover, in our parameter space explo-
ration, we vary both metallicity and C/O ratio but we
do not self-consistently include the variation of the T
profile with metallicity and C/O in our models. We dis-
cuss the effect of these approximations further in §4.
Our parameter space exploration  is focused on
investigating roles of C/O and Kzz across planets with
different Teq and Tint. For this, we run photochemical
models for 13 different C/O values between a range of
C/O ratios starting from 0.0458 to 1.125 with a step size
of 0.0916, exploring the very O- rich to very C- rich at-
mospheres at 10×solar metallicity. We also vary the Kzz
parameter between 106 to 1013 cm2s−1 with steps of 1 in
the log10 space. This range reflects the huge range
of uncertainty on this parameter covering cases of very
slow vertical mixing to rapid mixing. Therefore, in the
first parameter space exploration we compute chemical
kinetics models for each T profile shown in Figure 1
for a range of C/O and Kzz. For each model, we use
the X-ray/UV spectra for WASP-39b used in Tsai et al.
on the planet as we move the planet closer or further
away from the star to change its Teq.
We make this
choice as we want to explore the chemical trends in at-
mospheres as a function of varying Teq with a uniform
X-ray/UV flux incident on the planet. This is to avoid
changing this additional parameter while we sweep the
Teq parameter space. Our second part of the parame-
ter space exploration  is focused on exploring the
role of metallicity, C/O, Kzz, and Tint on the photo-
spheric abundances but at a fixed Teq. We present the
trends in photospheric abundance with varying Teq in
various planetary parameters in §3.4. We also present
trends in our estimates of photochemical precursors to
haze/soot across the parameter space in §3.5.
and Tint across different Teq
In this section, we present the variation of key molec-
ular abundances at the pressures typically probed by
transmission spectroscopy for transiting planets.
top three panels of Figure 3 shows an example of how
CH4 abundance profiles change with changing Kzz, Tint,
and C/O, respectively for a planet with Teq= 800 K.
The middle and bottom three panels of Figure 3 shows
the same but for SO2 and CO2, respectively. The ap-
proximate pressure range probed by transmission spec-
troscopy is shown with the red shaded region in each
panel. It is clear that Tint, Kzz, and C/O can cause sig-
nificant changes to the photospheric abundance of gases
like CH4 but Figure 3 also shows that not all gases are
equally sensitive to all of these parameters.
In order to present the trends in photospheric abun-
dance of gases with variations in these parameters, we
use a box-shaped kernel between 10 mbar and 0.1 mbar
which is also the region shaded in Figure 3. For each
gas abundance profile, we calculate the logarithm of the
average photospheric abundance using,
log10 =
R P2
P1 log10)dp
R P2
P1 dp
p1 is 10 mbar, and p2 is 0.1 mbar. This range covers
a typical pressure range probed by transmission spec-
troscopy. We present the trends in Xw for various gases
in the following sections.
CH4 is one of the major C-bearing gases in giant
planet atmospheres. Figure 4 shows the quantity Xw
for CH4 with a heat map as a function of Kzz and C/O
at various Teq and Tint values. Each row in Figure 4 cor-
responds to a different Teq from 1100 K to 600 K, while
each column corresponds to a different Tint from 30 K
to 500 K. We do not show the heat maps computed for
Teq of 1400 and 1600 K here as they are qualitatively
similar to the 1100 K case. The left most part of each
sub-figure shows the trend in CH4 Xw in the case of
thermochemical equilibrium.
Figure 4 shows that for Teq ≥1100 K, CH4 only
becomes abundant in the photosphere when the atmo-
sphere is very C- rich with C/O > 2×solar or when Kzz
C/O dependence for CH4, albeit their calculations as-
sumed thermochemical equilibrium. The amount of CH4
in the photosphere for these hotter planets shows some
Tint dependence when the vertical mixing is extremely
vigorous with Kzz ≥1012 cm2s−1.
In these cases, a
colder interior planet  shows
higher amount of photospheric CH4 than planets with
much hotter interior . This shows that

fect the CH4 abundance at much smaller pressures at

Figure 4 shows that for a given C/O, Tint, or Kzz,
the CH4 abundance is much higher in the Teq ≤900 K
planets than the Teq ≥1100 K planets. For Teq= 900
K, Figure 4 shows that the CH4 abundance varies very
strongly with Kzz. For a given C/O, the photospheric
CH4 abundance shows 6-7 orders of magnitude increase
with the Kzz increasing by 7 orders of magnitude. The
abundance of photospheric CH4 is much lower than the
expectations from thermochemical equilibrium for Kzz

between 30 K and 500 K from left to right. Note that the C/O is shown relative to an assumed solar value of 0.458 in this plot.
The last row in Figure 4 shows CH4 abundances for
Teq= 600 K. For these cold Teq values, CH4 abun-
dance shows a significant increase compared to the
Teq= 800 K cases. This increase is especially high for
Kzz≤1010cm2s−1. Also, the equal abundance contours
for Teq= 600 K, are nearly horizontal which shows that
the CH4 abundance is much more sensitive to C/O than
Kzz for these cold planets. At Teq= 600 K, for a given
C/O and Kzz value, the CH4 abundance shows a 2-3
orders of magnitude decrease with Tint increasing from
in Figure 4 show that while interpreting the C/O of a
planet from its measured CH4 abundance, one should
be particularly careful in parts of the parameter space
where the contours in Figure 4 are not horizontal. This
means that the same photospheric CH4 abundance can
be a result of a wide range C/O in these parts of the
parameter space. This also suggests that the CH4 abun-
dance, if detected, can be a good diagnostic of Kzz in
parts of the parameter space where the equal abundance
contours are nearly vertical. Figure 4 suggests that CH4
becomes a favorable marker of vertical transport when
Teq is between 800–900 K, which is slightly colder than
the ‘sweet-spot’ identified in the 3D models presented in
Zamyatina et al. . Note that we have shown these
trends at a fixed metallicity .
Figure 5 presents the Xw for CO across different C/O
ratios and Kzz.
Again, each panel corresponds to a
different Teq and Tint combination. For Teq= 1100 K,
Figure 5 shows that the CO abundance is only sensi-
tive to C/O showing a rapid increase with increasing
C/O around C/O∼0.3×solar.
Figure 5 suggests that
the CO gas can be a great tracer of C/O in planets
with Teq ≥1100 K irrespective of the strength of Kzz.

Figure 5. The weighted abundance of CO calculated using Equation 1 has been shown as a heat map as a function of C/O
and Kzz in each panel. Each row corresponds to a different Teq value from 1100 K to 600 K from top to bottom. Each column
correspond to a different Tint value between 30 K and 500 K from left to right. Note that the C/O has been shown relative to
the assumed solar value of 0.458 in this plot.
The CO abundane for a given C/O also shows almost
no Tint dependence for Teq≥1100 K. The difference in
CO abundance between the thermochemical equilibrium
and disequilibrium chemistry at Teq= 1100 K and 900
K is almost negligible. However, some Kzz dependence
of CO abundance appears at Teq= 900 K, when Tint≤
creasing Kzz when Kzz≥109cm2s−1. This decrease of
CO abundance with increasing Kzz beyond 109cm2s−1
is much more pronounced when Tint=30 K than the case
of Tint= 100 K. Similar behavior is also shown by the
Teq= 800 K models, where the Kzz dependence of CO
abundance for cold interior planets  sets
in at a slightly lower Kzz of 108cm2s−1. This suggests
that for planets with Teq at 800 K or 900 K and hot
interiors , CO can be a great tracer of
C/O, irrespective of Kzz and with minimal dependence
on Tint as well. But for such planets with cold interiors
Tint ≤100 K, whether CO will trace the C/O of the
atmosphere depends largely on the strength of Kzz.
The same behavior is not only shown but enhanced
further in Teq= 600 K planets shown in the last row of
Figure 5. The CO abundance mainly depends on Kzz
only in these cases for Tint ≤100 K and is dependant
only on C/O for Tint ≥200 K. This suggests that for
planets with colder Teq  and cold interiors
whereas for all the other cases of hotter planets or hotter
interiors, CO abundance is a great tracer of atmospheric
C/O.
The CO abundance in planets with cold interiors and
colder Teq values shows a decrease with increasing Kzz,
beyond a certain Kzz value, because their T profiles
straddle the CO=CH4 equal abundance curve . This has been shown in Figure 7 right panel,
where the black dashed curve shows the CO=CH4 equal

Figure 6. The weighted abundance of CO2 calculated using Equation 1 has been shown as a heat map as a function of C/O
and Kzz in each panel. Each row corresponds to a different Teq value from 1100 K to 600 K from top to bottom. Each column

abundance curve and the solid T profiles represent
Tint=30 K models with Teq lying between 1100 K and
tion of the figure and CH4 abundance decreases towards
the top right direction of the plot.
The black points
on each T profile show the quench points for CO,
when the Kzz is 106, 108, 1010, and 1012 cm2s−1. The
CO abundance remains almost constant with changing
Kzz if the quench pressure lie in the CO dominated re-
gion, which is the top right part above the CO=CH4
equal abundance curve.
If quenching happens in this
region, the quenched CO abundance is expected to be
insensitive to Kzz. However, if CO is quenched in the
lower left half, where CO abundance is rapidly decreas-
ing, then the CO abundance shows a rapid decrease with
increasing Kzz. This decrease is sharper because of the
isothermal nature of the T profile, which are far from
being parallel to the equal abundance contours of CO in
this part of the T −P space.
Another important behavior reflected in Figure 5 is
that the photospheric CO abundance remains the same
between thermochemical equilibrium and chemical dis-
equilibrium for Teq ≥900 K, but for colder planets, the
CO abundance in the thermochemical equilibrium cases
are smaller than the models with low Kzz values , irrespective of Tint. This suggests that even
though the CO abundance can act as a tracer of C/O
teriors, disequilibrium chemistry calculations must still
be used to interpret the correct C/O of a planet from
its measured CO abundance. This behavior is a direct
effect of the shape of the T profiles of these plan-
ets, when their Teq is ≤800 K and can also be under-
stood with the left panel of Figure 7. The T pro-
files of planets with Teq≤800 K transition from the CO-

four solid lines. The black dashed line shows the CO=CH4 equal abundance curve from chemical equilibrium calculations at

dominated to the CH4 dominated regions in the T −P
space, as shown in Figure 7. This leads to a sharp de-
crease in photospheric CO in these objects. However,
even for low Kzz values , the CO gets
quenched at much deeper pressures, where their T
profiles cross equal abundance contours corresponding
to higher CO abundance than the low photospheric CO
abundance expected from thermochemical equilibrium.
As the CO abundance becomes roughly constant on the
top right side of the CO=CH4 line, this doesn’t happen
when Teq≥900 K.
Figure 6 shows the Xw for CO2. At Teq= 1100 K, the
CO2 abundance shows a sharp decrease when C/O ≥
show such a sharp change in its abundance when C/O
is ≥1.9×solar as shown in the top panels of Figure 5.
CO2 shows this sharp decline beyond C/O ≥1.9×solar
due to the unavailability of enough O- atoms to form
CO2 when the C/O is approaching 1. At this Teq, CO2
remains practically independent of Kzz across all Tint
values, except for some slight Kzz sensitivity for Kzz≥
tospheric CO2 abundance doesn’t show much change
with changing C/O between 0.3×solar≤C/O≤1.2×solar
across all Tint values. This might limit the utility of CO2
as a C/O diagnostic for this range of C/O values. This
suggests the CO2 can be a good tracer for C/O in these
Teq ≥1100 K planets, except for very high strengths of
vertical mixing or for 0.3×solar≤C/O≤1.2×solar. CO2
also doesn’t show much dependence on Tint at this Teq.
CO2 has a larger Kzz dependence for planets with
Teq≤900 K. For Teq= 900 K and Tint= 30 K, the CO2
remains insensitive to Kzz for Kzz≤109cm2s−1. How-
ever, the CO2 shows very strong sensitivity to Kzz for
higher values of Kzz causing the CO2 abundance to drop
by two orders of magnitude with Kzz increasing by four
orders of magnitude. This behavior is present for hot-
ter Tint models as well, albeit with a slower decrease of
CO2 abundance with increasing Kzz. With increasing
Tint, the Kzz value at which CO2 transitions from being
insensitive to sensitive to Kzz also shifts slowly towards
higher value. The Teq= 800 K models shown in the third
row of Figure 6, also show the same qualitative behavior
as the Teq =900 K models, but with an even stronger de-
pendence of CO2 abundance on Kzz once the Kzz value
is higher than the “transition” Kzz value. This behavior
can be readily understood with the right panel of Figure
Each profile corresponds to a different Teq. The equal
abundance contours for CO2 from thermochemical equi-
librium are shown with the red lines. For planets with
hotter Teq or hotter Tint, most of the T profile lie in
parts of the T −P space where the CO2 equal abun-
dance contours appear less dense. This suggests that a
large change in quench pressure of CO2 due to changing
Kzz will only cause a small change in the quenched CO2
abundance for such T profiles. However, for planets
with colder Teq or colder Tint, the T profiles traverse
a denser region of equal abundance contours of CO2. For
these models, a change in quench pressure of CO2 due
to changing Kzz will produce a much more pronounced
effect on the quenched CO2 abundance. These models
suggest that for Teq=800 and 900 K planets, irrespective
of Tint, the CO2 abundance remains sensitive to Kzz to
varying degrees if Kzz is higher than a “transition” value
which is typically somewhere between 109-1010cm2s−1.
Other than the coldest interior case of Tint=30 K, the
CO2 abundance doesn’t show very strong dependence
on Tint.
Although for Teq≥800 K, the photospheric CO2 abun-
dances between thermochemical equilibrium and low
Kzz values are nearly the same, this breaks down for
Teq= 600 K. The CO2 abundance shows a sharp in-
crease between thermochemical equilibrium models and
Kzz=106cm2s−1 for these models.
This effect can be
understood with the interplay between the ‘U’ shaped
CO2 equal abundance contours and the T profiles
shown in the right panel of Figure 7. Most of the T
profiles of planets with Teq≥800 K remain in the T −P
space where the CO2 contours are less dense and nearly
vertical. As a result, the equilibrium abundance of CO2
monotonically and slowly increases with decreasing pres-
sure in these objects. Therefore, there is generally not
a large difference between the quenched abundance and
chemical equilibrium abundance of CO2 in these objects.
However, the Teq= 600 K model has a complex shape
with a nearly horizontal region traversing the densely
packed contours, where the chemical equilibrium CO2
abundance decreases rapidly. If the CO2 abundance is
quenched in this region, the quenched abundance will
be significantly higher than expected equilibrium chem-
istry abundance of CO2 in the photosphere. Moreover,
at Teq=600 K, CO2 depends almost solely depends on
Kzz, and not C/O, for Tint≤100 K. Some C/O depen-
dence of the photospheric CO2 abundance sets in for
higher Tint values. This suggests that near Teq=600 K,
the CO2 abundance can be a good tracer of Kzz for plan-
ets with cold interiors  but for planets with
hotter interiors, it can be quite degenerate between Kzz
and C/O.
The Xw for H2O is shown in Figure 8.
The range
of variation in Xw for H2O is much lower when com-
pared with other gases shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6.
H2O shows strong sensitivity to C/O when Teq= 1100
K without much dependence on Kzz. At Teq= 900 K,
when the Tint≥200 K, this behaviour of H2O abun-
dance being only dependant on C/O continues. The de-
pendence of H2O abundance on Tint is also extremely
weak in these cases.
H2O starts to show some Kzz
dependence when Kzz ≥1010cm2s−1 for Tint ≤100
K at Teq= 900 K. This behaviour continues for Tint≤
pendence of H2O abundance sets in a lower value of
Kzz≥109cm2s−1.
The H2O abundance shows an in-
crease with Kzz beyond this value which is also accom-
panied by a sharp decrease in CO and CO2 abundance
seen in this part of the parameter space in Figures 5
and 6, especially at Tint= 30 K. The H2O abundance
shows a decrease between thermochemical equilibrium
and the Kzz=106cm2s−1 chemical disequilibrium calcu-
lations for models with Teq≤800 K. This decrease is par-
ticularly strong for C/O≥1.7×solar for Teq= 800 K mod-
els. This decrease in H2O abundance between thermo-
chemical equilibrium and Kzz=106cm2s−1 is also seen
for Teq=600 K models.
However, the amount of de-
crease seen in these models increases with increasing
Tint at this Teq. This highlights that for these hotter
Tint values  at Teq ≤900 K, H2O can
still be a good tracer of C/O but chemical disequilib-
rium calculations must still be carried out to interpret
the C/O from H2O abundance accurately. The Teq=600
K models shown in the last row of Figure 8 show much
less sensitivity to Kzz compared to the Teq=900 K and
sensitivity shown by CH4 abundance to Kzz in Figure 4
at Teq= 600 K.
Figure 9 shows the Xw metric for NH3. NH3 neither
contains C- or O- and therefore is expected to not de-
pend strongly on C/O. All panels of Figure 9 reflect
this behavior. At Teq= 1100 K, the photospheres are
very NH3 poor. For Teq= 900 K, the photospheric NH3
abundance slowly starts to rise, much more for the colder
Tint models. The vertical equal abundance contours in
Figure 9 show that NH3 is very sensitive to Kzz in ad-
dition to high sensitivity to Tint. Similar to the CH4
behavior seen in the previous section, NH3 abundance
monotonically increases with Kzz. For the coldest inte-
rior of Tint= 30 K at Teq= 900 K or 800 K, NH3 abun-
dance increases by 7 orders of magnitude between Kzz
of 106cm2s−1 and 1013cm2s−1.
The equal abundance
curves for NH3 are known to be nearly parallel to the
adiabats for H2/He gas mixture in the deep atmosphere
the deep convective atmosphere, its photospheric abun-
dance will not be very sensitive to Kzz. NH3 can become

Figure 8. The weighted abundance of H2O calculated using Equation 1 has been shown as a heat map as a function of C/O
and Kzz in each panel. Each row corresponds to a different Teq value from 1100 K to 600 K from top to bottom. Each column
correspond to a different Tint value between 30 K and 500 K from left to right. Note that the C/O has been shown relative to

more sensitive to Kzz if it is quenched in the radiative
atmosphere in irradiated planets, where the lapse rate
of the T profile is very different than the adiabatic
lapse rate. The photodissociation of NH3 due to the in-
cident UV radiation also depends on Kzz. A low Kzz
in the upper atmosphere causes the NH3 abundance to
be depleted very rapidly with decreasing pressure. The
depletion of NH3 with decreasing pressure is much less if
the Kzz in the upper atmosphere is high. Both of these
effects shape the Kzz dependence of the NH3 abundance
shown in Figure 9 in the pressures typically probed by
transmission spectroscopy.
At Teq≤900 K, the NH3 abundance also declines by
several orders of magnitude as Tint rises from 30 K
to 500 K. Similar to the findings of Ohno & Fortney
photospheric NH3 abundance shows a very sharp rise
with Teq below Teq=800 K when vertical mixing is slow
the photospheric NH3 abundance shows a much more
gradual rise with Teq, as was also found by Ohno & Fort-
ney . Even though detecting NH3 has proven to
be a difficult task so far with JWST , its abundance can be of great use for reducing
the degeneracies discussed in the previous section aris-
ing from just fitting CH4 abundances and measuring Kzz
and Tint, especially for warm planets.
HCN is a molecule which is quenched due to Kzz
as well as produced photochemically.
Moreover, un-
like NH3, it has C- and therefore should be sensitive to
C/O. Figure 10 shows the Xw calculated for HCN. As
expected, photospheric HCN shows sensitivity to both
C/O and Kzz, and also depends on Tint. Figure 10 shows
that the disequilibrium chemistry abundance of HCN is
much higher than the expected thermochemical equilib-
rium abundance. The equal abundance contours in the
top row for Teq= 1100 K run diagonally which shows
that same HCN abundance can be very degenerate cor-
responding to a wide range of C/O ratios and Kzz for
these hotter planets. At Teq= 900 K ,800 K and 600
K, the HCN abundance is mostly sensitive to Kzz and
not much to C/O if Kzz is either low or very high. The
HCN abundance is not sensitive to either Kzz or C/O
for intermediate values of Kzz.
The detection of SO2 in WASP-39b has garnered great
interest in the community due to its photochemical ori-
gin. Figure 3 shows how SO2 is produced in a narrow
pressure region in the upper atmosphere. But as trans-
mission spectra of gas giant planets probes this partic-
ular pressure region as well, SO2 features can be easily
observed in transmission spectroscopy. Figure 11 shows
the Xw for SO2. At all Teq values except for 600 K, SO2
shows a sharp increase from thermochemical equilibrium
to disequilibrium chemistry cases.
For Teq= 1100 K,
the SO2 abundance only depends on C/O and shows a
small dependence on Kzz. For lower C/O values than
increasing Kzz for Kzz ≤1012cm2s−1 followed by a small
decrease for higher Kzz values. The nearly horizontal
equal abundance contours in the top row of Figure 11
shows that the SO2 abundance is much more sensitive
to C/O than Kzz at Teq=1100 K. The SO2 abundance
shows a gradual decrease with increasing C/O, which
is expected as the SO2 molecule contains two O- atoms
and no C- atoms. The decrease of SO2 with increas-
ing C/O is particularly rapid when C/O≥1.7×solar for
these hot planets, similar to CO2. This is again because
of the lack of enough O- atoms to form SO2 in these
very C- rich atmospheres. For these hotter planets, SO2
also remains independent of Tint.
For 800 K≤Teq≤900 K, the SO2 abundance is overall
higher than the Teq=1100 K. The SO2 abundance starts
to show strong dependence on Kzz at this Teq, espe-
cially for high Kzz values. This dependence particularly
sets in when the Kzz is higher than another “transi-
tion” value of Kzz. Below this transition value, the SO2
shows little to no dependence on Kzz, but once the Kzz
is higher than this value, SO2 abundance shows a rapid
decline with increasing Kzz. Figure 11 second row shows
that this transition Kzz depends on both C/O and Tint.
For example, at Teq=900 K, this “transition” Kzz can
be identified to be around 1010cm2s−1 when Tint=30 K.
But this “transition” Kzz is higher at Kzz=1012cm2s−1
for Tint=300 K. Qualitatively similar behavior is also ex-
hibited in the Teq=800 K models. SO2 shows another in-
teresting behavior for Tint≤200 K where the SO2 shows a
rapid increase with Kzz when C/O≥1.5×solar and Kzz
is between 1010-1012cm2s−1. The SO2 abundance then
declines rapidly when Kzz is increased further, which is
the effect discussed just above. This rapid increase of
SO2 with increasing Kzz before showing a decline occurs
for C/O≥1.0×solar in the Teq=800 K models shown in
the third row of Figure 11.
The SO2 abundance in the photosphere of the Teq=
tude than the Teq=800 K models.
This decline is
close to 6-7 orders of magnitude for values of Kzz
lower or higher than a narrow range of Kzz between
row range of Kzz values, the decline is only about by
narrow range of Kzz where SO2 is still relatively more
abundant than the rest of the parameter space, still ex-
ists. However, this region of the parameter space shrinks
progressively along both the C/O and Kzz direction
with increasing Tint.
This shows that below Teq≤600
K, it is very difficult to photochemically produce a de-
tectable amount of SO2, unless the atmospheric metal-
licity is much higher than 10× solar. The depletion of
SO2 at cool Teq is consistent with previous work and
is attributed to the depletion of OH radicals that are
needed to form SO2 
SO2 is not the only important S- bearing molecule in
these atmospheres. Figure 12, upper set of panels, shows
the volume mixing ratio of various S-bearing molecules
as a function of Teq and C/O at a fixed Kzz=109cm2s−1
and Tint=200 K. The volume mixing ratios at 1 mbar are
shown. The right-most panel in the middle row of Figure
declines sharply when Teq≤600 K or C/O ≥2×solar.
The same behaviour is also shown by SO. Figure 12 also
shows that SO is an almost equally abundant product of
photochemistry expected in the same part of the param-
eter space as SO2. Comparing the SO and SO2 panels
in Figure 12 also shows that SO declines slower with
increasing Teq compared to SO2. As both SO and SO2
decline at high C/O≥2×solar, most of the S- in the pho-
tosphere goes into CS instead. With the decline of SO
and SO2 at Teq≤600 K, CS and CS2 also start to carry
a large fraction of the S- inventory. This is particularly
interesting in the context of the recent tentative detec-
tion of CS2 in the atmosphere of TOI-270 d with JWST
which has a Teq between 350-380 K but is inferred to be
much more metal rich than 10×solar.

Among the other Sx kind of molecules S2 seems the
most abundant. Molecules like S3 and S4 are at least
estingly, the abundance of S8 is almost negligible for
Teq≥600 K, but Figure 12 shows that S8 and OCS shows
a very sharp increase in abundance for Teq≤400 K. Fig-
ure 12 shows that among the HxS gases, H2S is more
abundant than HS at 1 mbar, especially for Teq≥1200
K. We note that S- polymerization kinetics is still not
very well understood  and there
is also significant uncertainty in the OCS recombination
rates .
Figure 12, lower set of panels, shows the abundance
of the same gases but at 0.1 bar instead. It is clear that
almost all of the S- is present in the form of H2S with
a minor amount in the form of HS in the deeper atmo-
spheres. The abundance of gases like SO, SO2, and CS,
which are the dominant S- bearers near the pressures
probed by transmission spectroscopy, are much lower
at these deeper pressures.
This is expected as these
gasses are photochemically enhanced at the smaller pres-
sures. Interestingly, even though CS is more abundant
than CS2 in the upper atmosphere probed by transmis-
sion spectroscopy, CS2 appears to be more abundant
molecule in the deeper atmosphere probed by emission
spectroscopy. The most abundant S- carrying gas after
H2S in the deeper atmosphere is HS for Teq≥1000 K.
But below Teq≤1000 K, CS2 becomes the second-most
abundant S- carrying gas after H2S in the deep atmo-
sphere. For Teq lower than 500 K, OCS replaces CS2 as
the second most S- carrying gas after H2S.

that C/O can be degenerate with Kzz and Tint for most
gases at small or big parts of the parameter space. Here,
we explore how atmospheric metallicity influences pho-

this purpose with a Tint=200 K.

CO, OCS, H2O, and H2S as a function of  and

These models are shown
for a very O- rich atmosphere with C/O=0.1× solar
whereas Figure 14 shows the same quantities but for

The CH4 panel of Figure 13 shows
that at C/O=0.1×solar, increasing Kzz leads to increase
in CH4 when Kzz≤1010cm2s−1.
This holds true at
C/O=1×solar in Figure 14 too. The overall CH4 abun-
dances are much lower in the C/O=0.1×solar than the
C/O=1×solar, as expected. The equal abundance con-
tours for CH4 in the C/O=0.1×solar case 
are nearly vertical which suggests that the photospheric
CH4 abundance varies a lot with changing Kzz, but
not much with . This holds true at C/O=1×solar
as well  but only for ≤+0.5 and
shows that CH4 abundance can depend both on 
and Kzz, increasing as both of these parameters are
increased.
For metallicities higher than =+2.5,
CH4 abundance starts to decrease rapidly with increas-
ing metallicity for the very O- rich case shown in Figure
in the solar C/O models in Figure 14. Note that our
models do not account for graphite saturation , which could draw down the CH4 concen-
tration and impact other carbon-bearing species in Fig-
ure 14 for high metallicities .

crease with increasing Kzz. The equal abundance con-

like CH4 and NH3. This is expected as both SO2 and
CO2 require one C- or S- and two O- atoms per molecule.
It is interesting that for very O- rich atmospheres , the rate of increase of SO2 with increasing
This behavior also happens in the C/O=1×solar atmo-
spheres in Figure 14, but not to the extent present in
Figure 13. The metallicity dependence of SO2 only dis-
sappears when the Kzz is higher than a threshold value.
Beyond this value, the SO2 abundance shows a sharp
decline with increasing Kzz without much  depen-
dence. In Figure 13, this threshold appears to be close to
dependence for high Kzz values, but not to the extent
of the sharp change shown by SO2. For a given ,
the CO2 abundance shows a slight increase with increas-
ing Kzz when the Kzz is higher than 1011cm2s−1. For
lower Kzz values, the CO2 abundance solely depends on
Like CO2, CO shows little to no dependence on Kzz
and strong dependence on metallicity. The main reason
behind this is the relatively higher Tint=200 K of these
models. Interestingly, CO abundances in Figure 13 are
generally lower than the CO abundances in Figure 14.
This is the case as CO contains equal numbers of C- and
O- atoms, so its abundance is diminished in a very O-
rich and C- poor atmosphere. CO also shows some mi-
nor dependance on Kzz in the very O- rich atmospheres

ilar behavior as CO, where its abundance is diminished
in the very O- rich/C- poor atmospheres compared to
solar C/O atmospheres. The OCS abundance seems to
primarily depend on atmospheric  unless Kzz is
high. For high Kzz, the OCS abundance starts to in-
crease with increasing Kzz and this increase is particu-
larly rapid for significantly metal-enriched atmospheres.
This behavior is also mimicked by H2S, where its much
less abundant in the O- rich/C- poor atmosphere than
the solar C/O atmosphere. The photospheric abundance
of H2S also shows a rapid increase with increasing Kzz
beyond a threshold value, particularly in high 
atmospheres. Figures 13 and 14 show that H2O abun-
dance in the photosphere only depends on , with
almost no Kzz dependence at all.
Fortney et al.  and Ohno & Fortney 
presented how fundamental chemical transitions in the
atmosphere, like from being CO rich to CH4 rich, can
depend on both Tint and Kzz in addition to Teq. Re-
cently, Bell et al.  reported the discovery of CH4
in the atmosphere of WASP-80b detected in both trans-
mission and emission spectroscopy of the planet with
JWST. There have been efforts to measure the Teq value
below which CH4 first starts to appear in observations of
exoplanetary atmospheres. But this can be a complex
function of Tint, Kzz, C/O, and  .
Figure 15 presents these transitions/behavior from our
photochemical 1D chemical kinetics grid for three pairs
of molecules – CO-CH4, N2-NH3, and H2S-SO2-S at
how CO and CH4 photospheric abundance change with
decreasing Teq for Tint=30 K, 100 K, 200 K, and 500
K from left to right, respectively. Each panel in Fig-
ure 15 shows three colored solid lines denoting the CH4
abundance for three different Kzz values, whereas the
dotted lines indicate the CO abundance in each case.
It is clear that the upper atmosphere probed by trans-
mission spectroscopy can only have CH4≥CO in planets
with cold interiors Tint ∼100 K or lower. For hotter
interiors, CO always remains the majority C- carrier
molecule with higher abundance than CH4. This tran-
sition was seen to be happening at or below Tint=150
K too by Fortney et al. , even though they used
quench-time approximation for approximating the effect
of Kzz on chemistry and also did not treat photochem-
istry in their models.
We note that this threshold of
Tint=150 K was found at 3×solar metallicity in Fortney
et al.  instead of the 10×solar metallicity assumed
in our analysis. Figure 15 also shows that the Teq value
where this transition from CO rich to CH4 rich occurs is
a very strong function of Kzz. When Kzz=1012cm2s−1,
this transition happens near Teq= 1000 K for atmo-
spheres with Tint≤100 K. But, for Kzz=109cm2s−1 or
Kzz=106cm2s−1 , atmospheres can remain CO rich for
Teq above 600 K. When Tint= 500 K, shown in the right
most column of Figure 15, the CH4 abundance is still
an order of magnitude lower than CO even for Teq= 400
K.
The second row of Figure 15 shows the same quan-
tities as the first row but for NH3  and N2
the NH3 can only become the major N- carrier if the Tint
is 30 K. Even for such cold interior, the mixing needs
to be high to make NH3 carry most of the N- atoms
in the photosphere. For example, the NH3 in the pho-
tosphere still remains almost two orders of magnitude
lower than that of N2 abundance if Kzz=106cm2s−1,
even if Tint=30 K. This result is also consistent with the
findings of both Fortney et al.  and Ohno & Fort-
ney . Ohno & Fortney  found that NH3
can become the dominant carrier of N- atoms in giant
planets only in a small parameter space where the planet
has a low mass and is very old, such that the interior is
sufficiently cool and vertical mixing can dredge the NH3
up to the upper atmosphere.
The last row of Figure 15 shows the behavior of the
abundance of three major S- carrying species – H2S
in Figure 15 is that neither SO2 or H2S carries major-
ity of the S- inventory of the atmosphere, not atleast
at =+1.0. Instead, neutral S- atoms form a much
more substantial fraction of the total S- inventory in the
upper atmosphere than SO2. These are shown with the
faded dash dotted lines in all the panels and the same
phenomenon is also shown in Figure 12. This was seen in
previous work  as well. Figure
further. But the decrease of SO2 with decreasing Teq is
much more rapid as was also seen in Figure 12.
While we have presented our results on the detailed
chemical abundances at different parts of the parameter
space till now, here we present how this chemistry affects
the observable – the transmission spectra. The top panel
of Figure 16 shows the transmission spectra computed
from the Teq= 800 K, Tint= 200 K, C/O=1.1×solar, and

Figure 15. The variation of photospheric abundance of key atmospheric gases as a function of Teq is shown here. Each column
shows the variation for a different value of Tint. The top row shows the evolution of CH4 and CO abundance with Teq. The
middle and last row shows the same for N2-NH3, and H2S-SO2-S, respectively. In each panel, the three colored lines shows the
abundances for a three different values of Kzz. The C/O has been fixed to be 1×solar in these models.
It is clear that certain parts of the transmission spectra
are quite sensitive to Kzz while others are not as much.
For example, the CH4 band between 3-3.5 µm, and the
SO2 band at 4µm and 7-10 µm are quite sensitive to
Kzz. On the other hand, the H2O bands between 1-1.5
µm does not show as much sensitivity to Kzz.
The lower panel in Figure 16 shows the sensitiv-
ity of the transmission spectrum to Tint with a fixed
Kzz=1010cm2s−1.
The Tint has been varied from 30
K to 500 K. It is clear that the spectra is very CH4
dominated for cold interiors with Tint=30 K and 100
K. As the Tint increases further, the effect of CH4 on
the spectra slowly decreases. Looking at Figure 16, it
is not exactly clear at how the transmission spectrum
responds to changing Kzz and Tint in different parts of
the vast parameter space explored in this work. There-
fore, we present those trends in the upcoming section by
computing the differential of the transmission spectra at
each wavelength bin with changing Kzz and Tint.
To highlight the wavelength ranges where the trans-
mission spectra changes the most when a parameter
like Kzz is changed, we first renormalise all the trans-
mission spectra across our grid such that the mini-
mum transit depth of each transmission spectra is zero.
Then, we calculate the change in the renormalised tran-
sit depth within each wavelength bin from one grid
point to the next grid point.
For example, to high-
light which part of the transmission spectra changes the
most with a change in Kzz near Tint=30 K, Teq=800 K,
C/O=0.1×solar, =+1.0, and Kzz=108cm2s−1,

Figure 16. The top panel shows the variation of transmission spectra with changing Kzz while the bottom panel shows the
variation of the transmission spectra of the planet with changing Tint. The models shown here are for Teq=800 K, =+1.0,
and C/O=1×solar. The Tint has been fixed at 200 K for the top panel while the Kzz has been fixed at 1010cm2s−1 in the bottom
panel. Note that the transmission spectra have been renormalized in such a manner that the minimum transit depth of each
model is set at zero.
C/O for a fixed Teq= 800 K. The dF/dlogKzz quan-
tity shows how the transit depth in a given wavelength
change in parts-per-million  in a particular part
of the parameter space if Kzz is changed by one order
of magnitude there. We note that the dF/dlogKzz
quantity is sparsely sampled in the Kzz direction, and
as a result the trends shown in Figure 17 and 18 may
appear smoother than expected.
This quantity helps
us to identify which are the best wavelength range or
molecular features to constrain Kzz in a particular part
of the parameter space.
Figure 17 top row shows that if the interior of the
planet has Tint=30 K, the CH4 and CO2 bands near 3.3
µm and 4.2-4.3µm, respectively, show the most sensi-
tivity to changing Kzz.
However, it is clear that the
maximum change on the spectra due to changing Kzz
appears at different Kzz values depending on the C/O.
For example, in the C/O=0.1×solar panel on the top
left, the maximum change in the CH4 feature appears
at high Kzz values near 1010cm2s−1.
This region of
maximum sensitivity of the CH4 band shifts to lower
Kzz=108cm2s−1 value when the C/O is 1×solar and to
even lower Kzz= 107cm2s−1 when the C/O is 2×solar
in the top row. However, Figure 17 top row shows that
the CO2 band near 4.2-4.3 µm remains quite sensitive
to Kzz for almost all Kzz values in this cold interior
scenario.
As the Tint is increased from 30 K to 500 K , the
sensitivity of the CH4 bands to Kzz slowly diminishes
while the SO2 bands near 4µm and 7-9 µm become in-
creasingly sensitive to changing Kzz. This happens only
in the C/O = 0.1× and 1×solar columns. The sensitiv-
ity of the SO2 bands set in particularly for high values
of Kzz above 1010cm2s−1. The rest of the transmission
spectra still remains sensitive to Kzz but to a smaller
degree.
When C/O=2×solar, the CH4 bands remain
the most sensitive parts of the transmission spectra till
Tint≤300 K. The sensitivity of the 4.2-4.3 µm CO2 slowly
diminishes in this case as the interior warms up from a
Tint of 30 K to 500 K.

Figure 17.
Sensitivity of the transmission spectra to changing Kzz is shown here as a function of Kzz and wavelength. Each
column corresponds to a different C/O value whereas each row shows models for different Tint values. All models shown here
have Teq=800 K. A brighter red or a brighter blue color indicates that the transmission spectra is very sensitive to changing
Kzz at that Kzz and wavelength value.
Next, we present the trends in dF/dlogKzz at three
different Teq values in Figure 18, instead of the three dif-
ferent C/O values shown in Figure 17. Each column in
Figure 18 shows the trends for Teq= 600 K, 800 K, and
less sensitive to Kzz than those at Teq= 800 K and Teq=
spectrum arises in the CO2 bands  and CH4
bands  at low values of Tint. The
CH4 bands show some sensitivity but only when Kzz is
low whereas the CO2 band shows sensitivity for a larger
range of Kzz values. When the Tint ≥300 K, there is
reduced sensitivity to Kzz across the transmission spec-
trum at Teq=600 K.
The trends in the middle column of Figure 18 and
the middle panel of Figure 17 represent the same set
of models, so we don’t describe them again here. The
Teq=1100 K models shown in the right columns of Fig-
ure 18 show that the CH4 bands  are particularly sensitive to Kzz, especially at
high Kzz values but this sensitivity diminishes slowly
with increasing Tint value. The CO2 feature 
shows high sensitivity to Kzz across all Kzz values, but
this sensitivity slowly diminishes with increasing Tint at
Teq=1100 K. While the 4 µm SO2 feature doesn’t show
much sensitivity to Kzz for this Teq value, but the 7-9
µm SO2 is very sensitive to Kzz throughout all Tint and
Kzz values for the Teq=1100 K case. As it is not possi-
ble to present these trends for the whole suite of models
within this paper in a wavelength resolved manner, we
now move on to showing sensitivity of the transmission
spectra to changing Tint instead of changing Kzz.
Figure 19 presents the sensitivity of the transmission
spectra to changing Tint when the Tint changes within
our five Tint grid points of 30 K, 100 K, 200 K, 300 K, and
unlike for Kzz, we plot the quantity dF here, which is
simply the difference in the renormalized transit depths

Figure 18. Sensitivity of the transmission spectra to changing Kzz is shown here as a function of Kzz and wavelength. Each
column corresponds to a different Teq value whereas each row shows models for different Tint values. All models shown here
have C/O=1×solar. A brighter red or a brighter blue color indicates that the transmission spectra is very sensitive to changing
Kzz at that Kzz and wavelength value.
between two Tint values. Like Figure 17, each column
of Figure 19 also represents different C/O values. But
unlike Figure 17, each row of Figure 19 represents a
different value of Kzz with Kzz increasing from the top
to the bottom row. It is clear that for the very O- rich
case of C/O=0.1×solar shown in the left columns, the
sensitivity of the transmission spectra is very subtle to
changing Tint, especially for low Kzz values. But as the
Kzz values increase, the CH4 band between 
starts to show high sensitivity to changing Tint.
The C/O=1×solar models shown in middle column
of Figure 19 show a relatively higher level of sensitivity
to changing Tint value compared to the C/O=0.1×solar
models, especially for Kzz≥109cm2s−1. Most of the sen-
sitivity here is shown in the CH4 bands  and the sensitivity of the CH4 bands to chang-
ing Tint increases with increasing Kzz at this C/O value.
The CO2 absorption bands also show high sensitivity to
changing Tint values, especially for higher Kzz values.
For the C/O=2×solar models shown in Figure 19, most
of the sensitivity of the transit depth is mainly seen in
the CH4 bands  and the the CO2
band between 4.2-4.3 µm.
Figure 20 shows the sensitivity of the transmission
spectra at three different Teq values shown in each col-
umn for 600 K, 800 K, and 1100 K from left to right,
respectively. The C/O ratio has been fixed to 1×solar
for this purpose.
It is clear that the overall sensitiv-
ity of the transmission spectra to changing Tint dimin-
ishes with increasing Teq.
For Teq=600 K, the CH4
and CO2 bands show the most sensitivity to changing
Tint. This sensitivity increases progressively from low
Kzz to high Kzz at Tint=600 K. The Teq=1100 K mod-
els shown in the right column show much lower sensi-
tivity of the transit depths to changing Tint than the
Teq=600 K and Teq=800 K models. This is especially
true for Kzz≤109cm2s−1. However, when Kzz is higher
than this value, some Tint sensitivity starts to appear in
the spectrum. This sensitivity appears primarily in the

Tint and wavelength, instead of Kzz in Figure 17. Each column corresponds to a different C/O value whereas each row shows
models for different Kzz values. All models shown here have Teq=800 K. A brighter red or a brighter blue color indicates that
the transmission spectra is very sensitive to changing Tint at that Tint and wavelength value.
CH4, CO2 and CO bands  in the Kzz=1011
and 1013cm2s−1 cases.
Our sensitivity analysis of the transmission spectra re-
veals that the different wavelength regions in the trans-
mission spectra show complex sensitivity with changing
Kzz and Tint in different parts of the C/O, Teq, Kzz, and
Tint parameter space. This suggests that the precision to
which parameters like Tint and Kzz can be constrained
for giant transiting planets depends on where that planet
lands in this multi-dimensional parameter space. This
kind of analysis can also be used to carefully design
the wavelength region and the required signal-to-noise
to achieve a certain science goal  with instruments like JWST. We
avoid presenting similar analysis for eclipse spectroscopy
as we chose to ignore the disequilibrium chemistry pro-
cesses self-consistently within our T profile calcula-
tion and that would matter for emission spectra of these
planets to a much larger extent than the transmission
spectra analysis presented here.
Photolysis of C- bearing gases  in the up-
per atmospheres of gas giants can lead to formation of
gases like C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, etc, which in turn can act
as precursors to haze/soot creation, if the conditions are
favorable to further polymerization of these gases .
polymerization can be enabled by the reducing nature
of the upper atmosphere of these planets.
Hazes can
have large impact on the observed transmission, reflec-
tion, and emission spectra of exoplanets . While the Pho-
tochem kinetics model doesn’t track the growth of these
hydrocarbons to large polymers, we can still quantita-
tively estimate the abundances of these haze precursors
across the vast parameter space explored in this work.
We adopt the methodology presented in Morley et al.

Tint at that Tint and wavelength value.
and Tsai et al. , we include the following C- bear-
ing molecules to estimate the abundance of haze/soot
precursors– C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C4H2, HCN, CH3CN,
and CS2. We calculate the column density of these gases
at pressures smaller than 10−3 bars across our model
grid.
Each panel of Figure 21 shows the logarithm of the
column density of these precursors as a function of C/O
and Kzz. Similar to Figure 4, each column represents a
value of Tint while each row represents a different value
of Teq. Figure 21 shows that the abundance of haze pre-
cursors can be very strongly dependant on Kzz in plan-
ets with Tint≤100 K. This sensitivity of the haze pre-
cursor column density to Kzz diminishes with increas-
ing Tint at all Teq values. For Teq≤900 K models with
Tint=30 K, the abundance of haze precursors increases
first as a function of increasing Kzz before reaching a
peak, beyond which it decreases with increasing Kzz,
for a fixed C/O. The value of Kzz where this peak in
haze precursor abundance occurs is a strong function of
Teq.
For Teq=1100 K and Tint=30 K, this peak hap-
pens at or beyond Kzz=1013cm2/s, whereas at Teq=800
K and Tint=30 K, this peak occurs at Kzz=1010cm2/s.
At Teq=600 K, the peak occurs near Kzz=108cm2/s,
when Tint=30 K. Similar to the findings of Fortney et al.
dance of haze precursors shows an increase with de-
creasing Teq between Teq=1100 K and Teq= 900 K for
a fixed C/O and Kzz.
Below Teq=900 K, for models
with Tint≤100 K, whether the column density of pre-
cursors increases or decreases with decreasing Teq de-
pends largely on the Kzz and C/O. However, when the
Tint≥200 K, the column density of the precursors do not
show much change with decreasing Teq below Teq= 900
K, for a given C/O and Kzz value.
Above Tint≥100 K, C/O starts to influence the col-
umn density of haze precursors significantly, in addition
to Kzz. Figure 21 shows that the influence of C/O on
the precursors becomes stronger with increasing Tint for
all Teq. For planets with Tint ≥300 K, the precursor

Figure 21. The column density of haze precursors at pressures smaller than 10−3 bars has been shown as a heat map as a
function of C/O and Kzz in each panel. Each row corresponds to a different Teq value from 1100 K to 600 K from top to bottom.
Each column correspond to a different Tint value between 30 K and 500 K from left to right. The abundance of gases– C2H2,
C2H4, C2H6, C4H2, HCN, CH3CN, and CS2 were used to compute the column density of the haze precursor molecules.
column density shows a sharp increase when C/O ≥
teriors, the abundance of the precursors mostly remain
independent of Kzz. For a given value of C/O and Kzz,
Figure 21 also shows that the abundance of the precur-
sors show an overall decline with increasing Tint for all
Teq values.
This can be seen in the overall fading of
the brightness of the panels in Figure 21 as one goes
from left to right.
Figure 21 proves that the precur-
sors to larger haze molecules in the upper atmosphere
of H2/He rich atmospheres show very complex depen-
dence on Kzz, Tint, C/O, and Teq.
For planets with
hotter interiors both C/O and Kzz influence the avail-
ability of haze precursors in the upper atmosphere, but
for planets with low Tint, Kzz almost solely influences
the column density of these precursors in the upper at-
mosphere. This suggests that for low mass planets at
old ages, C/O might not be very correlated to the abun-
dance of hazes in their atmospheres.
However, these
results are only for 10×solar metal enrichment.
Figure 22 shows the how the column density of the
haze precursors vary with metallicity and Kzz.
top rows show models with Tint=30 K while the bot-
tom row shows models with Tint= 200 K. The left and
right columns show models at C/O= 0.1×solar and
C/O=1×solar, respectively.
All the models shown in
Figure 22 are for Teq=800 K. Figure 22 shows that
the amount of haze precursors in the upper atmosphere
generally depends both on  and Kzz, to varying
degrees, in all the four panels. When Tint=30 K and
C/O=0.1×solar , the amount of haze
precursor starts to show some  dependence when
the Kzz is between 109 and 1012cm2s−1. At Kzz val-
ues lower or higher than this range, the abundance of
haze precursors shows strong dependence on Kzz. For

But even when Kzz lies in
between these values, the variation of the precursor
abundances with changing  is much less rapid in
this hotter interior model compared to the top panel.
However, outside this range of Kzz values, the precur-
sor show strong dependence on Kzz. When the atmo-
sphere becomes more C- rich in these hotter interior
models , the haze precursor abun-
dance shows greater metallicity dependence. For these
models, the haze precursors become sensitive to Kzz for
Kzz≥1012 cm2s−1 and Kzz≤108 cm2s−1.
The maximum abundance of haze precursors occurs
between +1.0≤≤+1.5 for the top left panel, while
the bottom left panel shows maximum precursors be-
tween +0.5≤≤+1.5. For the top and bottom right
panels, maximum precursor abundances are reached be-
tween +1.3≤≤+2.5 and +1.5≤≤+2.0, re-
spectively. The top right panel, with C/O=1×solar and
Tint= 30 K, also shows that the maximum haze pre-
cursor abundance extends to higher metallicities , if Kzz is high. All the panels show that
the haze precursor abundances can be very low if mixing
is not vigorous enough. Comparing the top to the bot-
tom panel in both the columns of Figure 22 shows that
planets with lower Tint show enhanced levels of haze pre-
cursors at all , Kzz, and C/O values compared to
planets with hotter interiors. Both Figure 21 and Figure
planets at older ages might have a higher haze content
than higher mass planets. However, this only holds true
if their interiors have not been heated through external
perturbations.
Figure 2 has already established that there can be sig-
nificant differences in the T structure calculated us-
ing RCTE and RCPE models. This has been shown in
previous studies as well .
This self-
consistency between disequilibrium chemistry and T
profiles has been found to be important for atmospheric
models used to interpret the emission spectra of brown
dwarfs and directly imaged planets .
For the
high signal-to-noise spectra of these objects, these at-
mospheric details matter.
However, we have ignored the self-consistent approach
for the bulk of this work as it is not expected to matter
much in a parameter space exploration and identifica-
tion of major trends in chemistry, which is the main
focus of this work. The correction of T profile due
to RCPE calculations relative to RCTE models will typ-
ically be dependant on Kzz. Figure 23 shows the T
profiles computed with RCPE modeling for three differ-
ent Kzz values for a Teq=800 K object with =+1.0
and solar C/O. We calculate these RCPE profiles for
two Tint values of 100 K and 500 K, which are shown
in Figure 23 along with the RCTE T profiles com-
puted in each case. The chemical abundances in each
model for CH4, NH3, and SO2 are also shown.
It is
clear that the correction on the T profiles relative
to RCTE models is quite a strong function of both Kzz
and Tint. For example, the absolute δT in the Tint=500
K cases are larger but not very Kzz dependant, whereas
the absolute δT is relatively lower but much more Kzz
dependant in the Tint=100 K. Moreover, we also find
that the RCPE models have slightly different radiative-
convective boundaries from the RCTE models too. This
sensitivity can have modest effects on the absolute abun-
dances presented in this work but does not appear to be
strong enough to alter the trends presented here.
We have also made this simplification because here we
only explore the effect of the planetary parameters on
transmission spectra of planets. Drummond et al. 
has shown that the effect of the difference between
the RCTE and RCPE calculations is much stronger for
eclipse spectroscopy. Figure 23 reiterates this point and
suggests that RCPE models should be used when eclipse
spectroscopy data of warm and cold transiting planets
are interpreted.
UV spectra of host stars
Figure 3 shows that photochemistry shapes a signifi-
cant portion of the abundance profiles of gases like CH4
and SO2 in/near the pressures typically probed by trans-
mission spectroscopy. Therefore, another planetary pa-
rameter which can be influential on the photospheric
abundances of gases in irradiated giant planets is the
host star X-ray/UV spectra incident on the planetary
atmosphere.
The black-dashed line in the bottom panel of Figure
ter space exploration presented in §3. The other colored
lines show the same UV spectra multiplied with different
factors of 100×, 10×, 0.1×, and 0.01×. The top pan-
els in Figure 24 show the chemical abundance profiles
calculated for the same planet but with these different
incident UV fluxes on the planet. We use the Teq= 800
K, Tint= 300 K, Kzz= 106cm2s−1, and C/O= 1.1×solar
case for all results presented in this section. Abundance
profiles for SO2, CH4, NH3, and CO2 are shown from
top left to right, respectively. It is clear that changes in
the whole UV flux by five orders of magnitude does not
cause the peak SO2 abundance to change much, but in-
stead has a significant impact on the pressure where it is
produced, which can change by two orders of magnitude.
For CH4 and NH3, that same change in UV flux can
cause the pressure at which they are photochemically
depleted to change by a factor of 10. On the other hand,
the UV flux has almost no effect on the CO2 abundance
profiles. The middle panels in Figure 24 show the effect
of UV flux on the abundances when Kzz=1010cm2s−1.
The effect of the UV flux on the abundances are more
pronounced in this case compared to the lower Kzz case
shown in the top panel. Additionally, CO2 shows much
stronger variation in the upper atmosphere with chang-
ing UV flux when the mixing is strong. This exercise
shows that having constraints on the overall flux levels
of UV photons incident on giant planets is important for
interpreting abundances of some gases like SO2 or CH4
from observations.
We further explore the sensitivity of atmospheric
chemistry to different wavelength regions of the UV
spectrum. We take the nominal UV spectra from Fig-
ure 24 and divide it into a large number of wavelength
bins. Then, we boost the flux at each wavelength bin
by a factor of 100× and recalculate the chemistry while
keeping the rest of the fluxes in other wavelength bins
the same. Figure 25 shows the results from this exercise.

Figure 23. Difference between the T profiles calculated using the RCPE model for three different Kzz values and the RCTE
model is shown in the top left panel for a Tint=100 K model. The same differences are shown for a Tint=500 K model in the
top right panel. The three bottom left panels show the abundance profiles for each model for CH4, SO2, and NH3 at Tint=100
K. The same quantities for the Tint= 500 K model are shown in the three bottom right panels. All the models shown here are
for Teq=800 K, =+1.0, and C/O=1×solar.
The nominal UV spectra are shown in the three panels
in light gray, and the many vertical lines at the bottom
of each panel depict the wavelength bins that we use.
Each panel shows the quantity,
Y = log
X)
of a gas X calculated when the UV flux at wavelength
w has been boosted by a factor of 100. X) is the
abundance of the same gas calculated using the nominal
UV flux. When Y in Equation 2 is greater/lower than
zero, it means that the boost in UV flux in that wave-
length bin causes an increase/decrease in the abundance
of molecule X relative to the abundance calculated using
the nominal UV flux.
The top left most panel in Figure 25 shows Y for SO2.
It shows that the SO2 abundance near 0.1 to 3 mbar
shows a decrease if the UV flux between 200 to 240 nm
is boosted by a factor of 100. This sensitivity is due to
the high UV cross-section of SO2 between 200-240 nm
shown in Figure 26 in Appendix §7. It also shows that
the SO2 abundance is slightly enhanced between 1-10
mbar if the UV flux near 350-400 nm is boosted. The
SO2 also shows a small increase near the 0.1 mbar level
if the UV flux between 300-340 nm is increased. Both
of these enhancements in SO2 are linked with the addi-
tional destruction of S2 and CS2 when the flux between
tom left and bottom middle panels of Figure 25. This
enhanced destruction of S2 and CS2 is due to the strong
UV cross-sections of S2 and CS2 between 300-400 nm
and 300-350 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the Y map
for H2O in the bottom left panel shows the opposite
behavior than SO2 when fluxes in the same wavelength
ranges are boosted. But this is not visible in the plot as
we choose to keep the same color scale across all pan-
els in Figure 25 so that the sensitivity of each gas to
changing UV flux can be compared with the rest.
The top middle panel in Figure 25 shows Y for CH4.
CH4 abundance shows a small decrease near 0.1-3 mbar
region when fluxes between 350-400 nm are boosted.

Figure 24. The upper set of panels show the change in abundance profile of key molecules due to change in the X-ray/UV flux
incident on the planet when Kzz=106cm2s−1. Profiles for SO2, CH4, NH3, and CO2 are shown from left to right, respectively.
The black-dashed line shows the profile for the nominal case. The middle row compares the abundances when Kzz=1010cm2s−1.
The lower panel shows the X-ray/UV spectrum used to calculate each of these models.
CH4 also shows a sharp decrease near the 0.1-0.6 mbar
level when flux between 300-350 nm is increased by a
factor of 100. Like SO2, NH3 abundance also shows a
sharp decrease between 0.1-3 mbar when flux between
UV cross-section of NH3  between 200-
when UV fluxes at wavelengths higher than 300 nm are
boosted. Comparing Figure 24 and Figure 25 shows that
determining the level of UV flux incident on the whole
planet in very broad wavelength bands is much more
important than determining the very detailed nature of
the UV SED to interpret the chemical abundances in
irradiated planet atmospheres and connecting them to
planetary bulk properties. However, we note that pho-
tochemical kinetics calculations are highly non-linear in
nature and our calculations have several simplifications.
For example, a more comprehensive radiative–transfer
approach like Monte–Carlo radiative transfer and T −P
dependant UV cross-sections might provide additional
insights.
Our photochemical model does not track alkali met-
als and other condensibles relevant to the deep portions
of gas-giant atmospheres. In reality, species like Na2S
and MnS, which we do not model, should condense at
relatively high pressures and temperatures which may
prevent some amount of sulfur from reaching the up-
per atmosphere .
Therefore,
our omission of these species should cause our simula-
tions to over-predict the abundance of sulfur gases  in the upper atmosphere. However, we expect our
Figure 25. This plot shows how the abundance of a certain gas changes at a given pressure when the UV flux at a given
wavelength bin is increased by a factor of ×100. This has been quantified with Y in Equation 2. This Y quantity has been
plotted as a heat map in each panel for SO2, CH4, NH3,H2O, CO2, SO, S2, CS2, and HCN. The X-axis in each panel is the
wavelength of the UV flux and the Y-axis is pressure in the atmosphere. The wavelength bins used for boosting the UV fluxes
are also shown as vertical lines at the bottom of each panel along with the nominal UV spectra incident on the planet. A positive
value for Y at a given pressure and wavelength means that the molecular abundance has increased relative to the nominal case
when UV flux at those wavelengths were boosted. A negative Y value corresponds to a decrease instead.
over-prediction to be small and inconsequential, because
sulfur should be far more abundant than the alkali met-
als. For example, the Sun has ∼10× more sulfur atoms
than sodium atoms , meaning Na2S
condensation could, at most, only sequester about 5% of
the available sulfur. In summary, we expect the lack of
condensibles in our photochemical model to cause our
results to over-estimate the sulfur in the upper atmo-
sphere by an amount that does not effect our overall
conclusions which is based on order-of-magnitude trends
in sulfur bearing species.
To achieve a photochemical steady-state, the Pho-
tochem code integrates the photochemical equations for-
ward in time until the atmosphere ceases to change. Our
code identifies convergence to such a steady-state with
the following criteria:
fij −fij
tn/2
is the current integration time, making ∆ymax the max-
imum relative change over the last tn/2 seconds. We
assume a steady-state is achieved when ∆ymax < 0.05
and ∆ymax
appropriate over a wide parameter space. Furthermore,
the VULCAN photochemical code  uses
similar convergence requirements that have proved reli-
able for warm gas-rich planets ).
Photochem, like many other chemical kinetics models
mospheric chemistry in a grid of atmospheric altitudes
instead of the pressure space used in the PICASO climate
model. As a result, as the chemistry of the atmosphere
evolves in the chemical kinetics model, the mean molecu-
lar weight of the atmosphere also changes. So, when the
altitudes are converted back to pressures after the kinet-
ics models have converged, the T profile effectively
becomes ever so slightly different than the input T
profile. To avoid this, the Photochem code adaptively
re-grids and adjusts the temperature profile during inte-
gration as to ensure the T profile matches the input
PICASO T profile. This approach is particularly very
important for the RCPE models we have presented in
this work, where the chemical kinetics model is itera-
tively coupled directly with the climate model.
We have explored the variation of atmospheric chem-
istry in close-in giant transiting exoplanets across a vast
parameter space of bulk planetary properties like Teq,
Tint, , and C/O. Our exploration includes chemi-
cal disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing and
photochemistry and is applicable for a wide variety of
planets in terms of their mass, age, and proximity to
their host stars. We have arrived at the following con-
clusions from this exploration,
dances of gases like CH4 can be sensitive to just
the Kzz parameter or just the C/O ratio or can
also be quite degenerate between the two depend-
ing on the bulk properties of the planet like Tint or
Teq and also atmospheric properties like the vigor
of vertical mixing. We have identified these trends
in this work at different parts of the parameter
space.

unless the Tint of the planet is ≤100 K. For these
cold interior planets, CO can become much better
tracers of Kzz than C/O.

ularly enhanced for cold interiors. We also show
that NH3 is an excellent tracer of Kzz, without
much dependence on C/O, as expected.
on the other
hand depends quite strongly on the C/O of the
planet unless the Kzz exceeds high values like ∼

For these colder Teq planets, we find that the
S- content of the photosphere is carried by other
gases like CS, CS2, and S8.
We also find that
atomic S is a major carrier of S- near the photo-
sphere irrespective of Teq.
gases in the atmosphere behave in the  vs.
Kzz space. Among other trends, we find that other
S- carriers like OCS and H2S can show a rapid
increase with Kzz in the photosphere, especially
for metal enriched objects.
in the atmosphere with Teq, we explore the Teq vs.
abundance trends of gas combinations like CO-
CH4, NH3-N2, and SO2-H2S-S. Our findings on
these key transitions reflect the findings from pre-
vious work . Interestingly, we find that even
in the photosphere, atomic S can carry a signifi-
cant fraction of the S- inventory along with H2S
and SO2.
sion spectra to parameters like Kzz and Tint in
different parts of the parameter space, we present
a wavelength resolved sensitivity analysis of the
transmission spectra to these parameters. We find
that the sensitivity of the transmission spectra to
these parameters is quite complex. In some parts
of the parameter space, the CH4 absorption bands
might show great sensitivity to Kzz, while in some
parts the CO2 or SO2 bands might show the high-
est sensitivity to changing Kzz or Tint.
molecules like C2Hx, HCN, etc, which can act as
precursors to photochemical hazes in the upper at-
mosphere. We find that these precursors molecules
show very strong dependence on Kzz and almost
no dependence on C/O for planets with cold interi-
ors  at 10×solar metallicity. We also
find that planets with low Tint are likely to have
significantly higher abundance of haze precursors
in the upper atmosphere compared to planets with
hotter interiors. This is especially relevant to older
low mass planets with no external heating.
There are several aspects of our modeling of giant
planet atmospheric chemistry which can be improved
in the near future. These include inclusion of more ele-
ments in our chemical kinetics calculations and inclusion
of condensation and rainout chemistry within our chem-
istry calculation as well.
We think that the assump-
tions made in our modeling approach are sufficient for
the typical quality of transmission spectra obtained with
JWST, especially in the near-future. But these kind of
improvements might lead to new avenues of character-
izing the physics and chemistry of giant planet atmo-
spheres and also their bulk properties.
