In this study, we present the pulse profile of the unique and the second brightest gamma-ray burst
GRB 230307A, and analyze its temporal behavior using a joint GECAM–Fermi/GBM time-resolved
spectral analysis. The utilization of GECAM data is advantageous as it successfully captured sig-
nificant data during the pile-up period of the Fermi/GBM. We investigate the evolution of its flux,
photon fluence, photon flux, peak energy, and the corresponding hardness-intensity and hardness-flux
correlations. The findings within the first 27 seconds exhibit consistent patterns reported previously,
providing valuable insights for comparing observations with predictions from the synchrotron radiation
model invoking an expanding shell. Beyond the initial 27 seconds, we observe a notable transition in
the emitted radiation, attributed to high latitude emission , influenced by the geometric prop-
erties of the shells and the relativistic Doppler effects. By modeling the data within the framework
of the large-radius internal shock model, we discuss the required parameters as well as the limitations
of the model. We conclude that a more complicated synchrotron emission model is needed to fully
describe the observational data of GRB 230307A.

A comprehensive understanding of the physical origins
of gamma-ray burst  pulses is crucial to unravel
the complexities of the overall GRB phenomenon and to
shed light on the nature of the inner engine and associ-
ated radiation processes .
The individual GRB pulses typically exhibit a charac-
teristic temporal evolution, characterised by a rapid rise

yu.wang@inaf.it;xiongsl@ihep.ac.cn
followed by an exponential decay, often referred to as
the “FRED” shape .
However, statistical investigations of the decay phase
of smooth FRED pulses within the Burst and Transient
Source Experiment  have shown that many of
these pulses do not conform to exponential behaviour
Therefore, the exploration of alternative functions, such
as power-law functions, has been proposed to explain
this decay trend .
During the decay phase, the spectral hardness of GRB
pulses demonstrates a noticeable decrease. A significant
fraction of pulses in this phase appear to satisfy spe-

cific relations between their temporal and spectral prop-
erties, such as the hardness-intensity correlation 
lation  .
Based on these empirical findings, and with the goal of
comprehending the radiative mechanisms responsible for
the cooling process, it is essential to concentrate on the
decay phase of GRBs’ prompt emission. Furthermore,
it is vital for theoretical models to replicate these ob-
servational results, as they can help distinguish among
various possibilities; .
In this regard, in this paper we conduct a comprehen-
sive investigation into the spectral and temporal charac-
teristics of GRB 230307A, the second brightest gamma-
ray burst  detected in over 50 years, character-
ized by its long-duration prompt emission .

pact stellar merger origin of GRB 230307A . The emer-
gence of an X-ray component after the prompt γ-ray
emission phase suggests a magnetar engine  ). Detailed analy-
ses of the temporal spectral behavior suggest that the
emission is likely synchrotron radiation from a Poynting-
flux-dominated jet, with evidence of mini-jets suggested
in the internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection
and turbulence  model , even
though other possibilities have also been discussed .
The high brightness of GRB 230307A caused the
Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor  to encounter pulse pile-up and data loss
during the prompt emission from T0+1 s to T0+20 s
This issue was
also observed in the case of another bright GRBs, e.g.
GRB 221009A . However, the Gravi-
tational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart
All-sky Monitor , success-
fully obtained significant data during the pile-up period
of the Fermi/GBM, showcasing its unique capability to
capture data from highly luminous GRBs. This ability
of GECAM provides valuable insights into the nature of
exceptionally bright GRBs.
Utilizing data obtained from both GECAM and
Fermi/GBM, we perform a time-resolved spectral anal-
ysis during the first 100 seconds of GRB 230307A. Our
analysis, as shown in section 2 reveals consistent be-
havior with the Hardness-Intensity Correlation 
and Hardness-Fluence Correlation  relations as
reported by Ryde & Svensson  derived from
a sample of 25 bursts.
In view that this spectral evolution behavior is con-
sistent with a general synchrotron radiation model in-
volving a large emission radius, we investigate how
the model may be consistent with such models, espe-
cially the widely discussed internal shock model .
We consider relativistic ejection as a continuous pro-
cess, with internal shocks taking the form of propagat-
ing shock waves within the outflow. We utilize a ver-
sion of the internal shock model developed by Daigne
one pair of internal shocks at a large emission radius.
This approach results in pulse shapes during the decay
phase, determined by the hydrodynamical timescale as-
sociated with the propagation of these shock waves.
We point out the limitations of this model and discuss
possible solutions to improve the model. In particular,
we echo the suggestion of Yi et al.  that the full
dataset of GRB 230307A demands a more complicated
large-radius synchrotron radiation model invoking mini-
jets, as envisaged within the framework of ICMART
model .
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
the detailed methodology of the time-resolved spec-
tral analysis applied to GRB 230307A using data from
GECAM and Fermi-GBM. In section 3, we provide a
brief overview of the internal shocks  model em-
ployed in this study.
Section 4 focuses on investigat-
ing the astrophysical model parameters required in the
IS model to explain the observed temporal and spectral
evolution of GRB 230307A and the limitations of the
model. Finally, in section 5, we present the concluding
remarks of our study.
On March 7, 2023, at 15:44:06 UT  the Gravi-
tational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart
All-sky Monitor  was triggered in-flight by
this exceptionally bright long burst and the low latency
alert reporting the GECAM discovery of this extremely
bright burst initiated a global observation campaign
The GECAM light curve shows
a roughly FRED shape with a possible precursor and
an overall duration of about 100 seconds .
The GECAM duration  of this burst is
At the same time, the Fermi Gamma-
ray Burst Monitor  detected and located GRB
a single burst in 10-1000 keV with a duration  of
approximately 35 seconds . With
a redshift estimated to be z ∼0.065 , the isotropic energy measured by GECAM-B is
Eiso = 4.8×1052 erg.
As of the detection of GRB 230707A, GECAM con-
sists of three separate satellites: GECAM-A, GECAM-
B, and GECAM-C. GECAM-A and GECAM-B were
launched in December 2020 , while
GECAM-C,
SATech-01
satellite,
launched in July 2022 .
Each GECAM satellite has two kinds of scientific in-
struments: gamma-ray detectors  and charged
particle detectors .
There are 25 GRDs on-
board GECAM-B and 12 GRDs onboard GECAM-C.
GRB 230307A was detected by both GECAM-B and
GECAM-C, and neither GECAM-B nor GECAM-C suf-
fered saturation during the event. GRD04 of GECAM-
B and GRD01 of GECAM-C are selected for spectral
analysis due to their smallest zenith angles to the burst.
These two detectors operate in two readout channels:
high gain  and low gain , which are indepen-
dent in terms of data processing, transmission, and dead
time.
For GRD04 of GECAM-B, the energy range of the HG
channel data is used from about 40 keV to 300 keV, while
the energy range of the LG channel data is used from
about 700 keV to 8000 keV. For GRD01 of GECAM-
C, only the HG channel data is used with an energy
range from 6 keV to 100 keV. It should be noted that
the response of GRD01 of GECAM-C for the 6-15 keV
range is affected by certain instrumental effects, which
may result in inaccuracies. This issue is currently being
studied. The background of GECAM-B is estimated by
fitting the data from T0-50 s to T0-5 s and T0+160 s to
T0+200 s with first order polynomials.
The background of GECAM-C is estimated by fitting
the data from T0-20 s to T0-1 s and T0+170 s to T0+600 s
with a combination of first and second-order exponential
polynomials.
It is noteworthy that GECAM features a unique and
optimized design specifically for detecting extremely
bright GRBs.
In addition to employing transmission
channels with large capacity and broad bandwidth, ad-
jacent detectors with similar pointing are read out by
independent electronic modules.
Thanks to these so-
phisticated designs, the count rate upper limit of each
GRD can reach up to 100 kcps, significantly exceeding
the count rate of GRB 230307A detected by GECAM.
In this study, we also utilize the Time-Tagged Event
one of the two scientific instruments on board the Fermi
satellite, the other being Fermi/LAT. The Fermi/GBM
instrument is equipped with two types of detectors,
namely 12 Sodium Iodide  detectors  and 2
Bismuth Germanate  detectors .
Due to the high brightness of GRB 230307A, GBM ex-
perienced pulse pile-up and data loss during the prompt
emission, resulting in the creation of Bad Time Intervals
To supplement the GECAM data when the source is
not as bright ,
we carry out a joint analysis using GBM data, using the
na detector ranging from 8 keV to 900 keV, and the b1
ranging from 0.3 MeV to 8 MeV.
The spectral analysis is conducted using the Pyxspec
software .
The exceptional
brightness of GRB 230307A enables the execution of
spectral analysis with a significantly high time resolu-
tion. The time intervals used in this study are deter-
mined based on the results of the Bayesian block anal-
ysis , with additional adjustments
made based on the fitting results.
Specifically, during the period of high brightness from
T0 to T0+15 s, the time intervals are set to 0.1 s in or-
der to achieve a more refined time-resolved spectrum.
During the period of decreased burst intensity, specifi-
cally from T0+ 15 s to T0+ 32 s, the time intervals are
adjusted to 0.5 s. This choice allows for a more refined
analysis of the dip spectrum, ensuring an adequate num-
ber of photons for accurate fitting. Following T0+32 s,
the time intervals are primarily determined based on the
Bayesian blocks analysis results. However, these inter-
vals are further adjusted multiple times to ensure opti-
mal fitting of each bin, aiming for narrow and well-fitted
bins.
Three distinct photon spectral models are chosen for
analysis: BAND model , the power law
with a high-energy exponential cutoff  model, and
the simple power law  model. In addition, we incor-
porate the uncertainties arising from cross-calibration
by introducing multiplicative factors between different
detectors. Table 1 presents the best-fit parameters ob-
tained for each time interval of GRB 230307A. The
columns include the time interval, the best-fit model,
the α parameter for the PL, CPL, or BAND function
when applicable, the β parameter for the BAND func-
tion in intervals where it is the best fit, the peak energy,
the flux, the photon flux, the CSTAT value, and the de-
grees of freedom  to assess the goodness of fit for
the best model. Additionally, we thoroughly explored
the potential need for an additional spectral component,
such as a thermal component, to fit the spectra. How-
ever, we did not find any statistically significant evidence
supporting the necessity of such an extra component.
The optimal model is determined using the Bayesian
Information Criterion . The BIC is
defined as BIC = −2lnL+klnN, where L represents the
maximum likelihood value, k denotes the number of free
parameters in the model, and N signifies the number of
data points. A model with a lower BIC value is pre-
ferred, particularly when the difference in BIC 
exceeds 10. In the best model, all parameters should be
well–constrained, and the multiplicative factors should
be approximately equal to 1.
The characteristics of the gamma-ray of the burst can
be inferred from the temporal changes in the light curve
and the spectral properties; . These observations have uncovered various sta-
tistical relationships between different measurable quan-
tities, providing valuable insights and limitations on the
physical models that govern the production of gamma-
rays .
The advent of new satellites like GECAM  has further enhanced our ability to study and un-
derstand these phenomena.
As explained in the previous subsections, we examined
the potential evolution of the spectral shape during the
decay phase of GRB 230307A, but no significant changes
were observed; see also Table. 1. We now study the tem-
poral behaviour of the energy flux FE, the photon flux
N and spectral peak energy Ep. FE is related
to N and Ep by 
FE = NEp

with N representing the spectral shape. Figure. 1
shows the joint GECAM+Fermi/GBM evolution of the
above functions, namely FE, N, Ep, φ,
as well as the photon fluence Φ. These functions are
obtained from the best fit parameters determined in Sec-
tion 2, and reported in Table. 1.
Ryde & Svensson  have shown that the decay
behavior of the photon flux, N, is a consequence of
the validity of both the Hardness-Intensity Correlation

phase, and it serves as a reference point from which
the decay behavior of the photon flux N = N0 is
measured, and τ is a constant. Subsequently, Ryde &
Svensson  found that the distribution of n in their
sample was peaked around n = 1.
Based on our comprehensive analysis of data obtained
from the joint analysis of GECAM and Fermi/GBM, we
find that none of FE, Ep, and N can be accu-
rately described by a single decaying power law over the
entire post maximum emission period, extending from
the initial decay time td1 = 7.2 s to t ∼100 s.
We then investigate the behavior of the flux and fit it
using a broken power-law model. The best fit parame-
ters, as shown in Fig. 2 reveals a break time t = 27±2
s, with the first index α1 = 1.55 ± 0.10 and the second
index α2 = 2.98 ± 0.16. Therefore, we denote the break
time of the flux as td2 = 27 s, representing the initiation
of the second decay phase of the flux.
Within the range of td1 = 7.2 s to td2 = 27 s, we ob-
serve that FE ∝1/t, Ep ∝1/t,
N ∝1/t, and φp ∝E

These lead to HIC and HFC relations

FE, believed to be intrinsic to the emission process,
is consistent with the correlations identified by Liang
et al. , Ghirlanda et al. , Lu et al. ,

panel shows the photon flux evolution, N, in photons.cm−2.s −1. The forth panel shows the spectral peak energy evolution,

s to td2 = 27 s indicates the time interval of the decay phase studied.
Beyond td2 = 27 s, the decay behavior follows FE ∝
temporal behaviour aligns with the characteristics of
high latitude emission , which persists after the
on-axis emission from the final dissipating regions in the
relativistic outflow ceases; . Such a HLE emission is in general consistent with
the cessation of synchrotron emission in a large emis-
sion radius, such as the ICMART model  and the large-
radius internal shock model  ). The photosphere models  have a much smaller emission
radius, so that the high-latitude emission timescale is
expected to be much shorter and exhibit a rapid de-
cay , which is inconsistent with

the data. Furthermore, the spectral analysis presented
in Table 1 shows no evidence of statistically significant
thermal components, which are essential indicators of
photospheric emission in such analyses.
In the subsequent analysis, it is therefore crucial to in-
vestigate the decay behavior of FE, Ep, and N
within a general framework of synchrotron radiation at a
large emission radius. A practical model is the large ra-
dius internal shock model , because it has less parameters than
the ICMART model that invokes multiple minijets  and Shao & Gao  for de-
tailed modeling) and because the two models share sim-
ilar global properties in terms of FE, Ep, and N
evolutions. We want to, however, emphasize the caveats
of the IS model. Since additional rapid variability is ob-
served on top of the broad pulse profile of GRB 230307A,
in order to fully interpret the data within the IS model,
additional small-radius shocks are needed to account for
the rapid variability. The superposition between small-
radius ISs and a large-radius IS is actually disfavored
by the data of GRB 230307A . Nonethe-
less, the goal of the following investigation is to see how
good the simplest IS model can reproduce the general
behavior of this burst.
The internal shock model, introduced by Rees &
Meszaros , explains the GRBs originating from
compact stellar-mass objects. It suggests that a wind
emitted by such objects has an uneven distribution
of speed, resulting in faster sections catching up with
slower ones, generating gamma-rays through radiative
processes such as synchrotron or inverse Compton radi-
ation through internal shocks ;
Internal shocks  were initially thought to be dis-
crete shell collisions , but this led
to discrepancies with observed GRB decay rates due to
the “curvature effect.” In the multiple shells IS scenario,
the long-term overall trend of the light curve reflects the
activity history of the central engine, showing neither
shape-energy dependence nor any power-law behavior
in the luminosity trend. This random behavior is not
surprising, as the cluster of shells is randomly generated
and possesses random mass and velocity.
Within a relativistic wind characterized by a nonuni-
form Lorentz factor, internal shocks occur and transform
a fraction of the kinetic energy into radiation. Our ap-
proach involves depicting the irregular wind as a series
of relativistic shells, with the collision of two shells con-
stituting the fundamental process in this model. When
multiple shells are present, numerous collisions occur.
To delineate the temporal structure, we compute the
time sequence of these two-shell collisions and overlay
the resultant pulses from each collision.
A rapidly-moving shell 
overtakes a slower one , and the two combine to cre-
ate a single merged shell . This system mimics an
inelastic collision between two masses mr and ms. By
applying the principles of energy and momentum con-
servation, we determine the Lorentz factor of the merged
shell to be :

γrmr + γsms

FE aligns with the findings of previous studies by Liang et al. , Ghirlanda et al. , and Lu et al. . The
Hardness-Fluence Correlation  is illustrated panel B, while the Hardness-Intensity Correlation  is shown in the

leased in a single emission event, specifically relevant
to GRB 230307A, characterized by immediate emission
without distinct intervals between pulses. By simulating
the ejection of multiple randomized shells from the cen-
tral engine, we are able to closely monitor the properties
of each individual shell. For instance, we eject 50 shells,
with their initial thickness, Lorentz factor, and mass
chosen from random distributions in log space.
Lorentz factors vary from 100 to 1000, the mass ranges
from 1028 to 1029, and the initial thickness ranges from
ejection times are randomly selected from a linear distri-
bution, with values ranging from 0 to 20 seconds in the
rest frame of the GRB central engine. Upon collision,
two shells merge, and the merged shell parameters  are adopted as the new values for the remaining
shell.
To ensure the tracking of future collisions, the
tej,m = R/cβm, where βm = 1/2. The simu-
lation then restarts with one less shell. This process is
repeated for each collision, allowing the code to monitor
all collision/merging events for any arbitrarily designed
central engine activity .
To determine Ep, we utilize an empirical relation-
ship between the isotropic emission energy Eiso and Ep,
which has been found to be widely applicable to GRBs
time-resolved analysis of individual bursts . This relationship has also
been demonstrated to be valid in GRB 230307A, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 3. We assume the validity of this cor-
relation, represented by the equation:
Ep = 100 keV
The photon flux N in the energy channel 
is approximately given by Eq. 1:

sents the superposition of all L from each collision as

listed in Table. 1. The simulation results for  are depicted in Fig. 4. The
light curve does not follow a specific trend, and the
trend changes for each set of random variables.
As outlined in the preceding subsection regarding the
multiple shells IS scenario, where a cluster of shells is
generated randomly with varying mass and velocity, the
extended light curve demonstrates neither a correlation
between shape and energy nor any power-law pattern
in luminosity trends. To address this, a different model
proposed by Daigne & Mochkovitch  consid-
ers continuous relativistic ejections, resulting in shock
waves propagating within the outflow.
This modified
approach effectively considers one single collision at a
large emission radius, which better matches the observed
data, showing slower pulse decays . The simplified model in this context by Daigne &
Mochkovitch  approximates the flow evolu-
tion, treating the wind as solid shells interacting through
collisions, while disregarding pressure waves present in
a full hydrodynamical scenario .
In our investigation of the decaying phase of the burst,
we employ a simplified pulse analytic model proposed
by Daigne & Mochkovitch . Given that our focus
is solely on the overall decaying behavior and not on
calculating variability in this particular burst , we have chosen to utilize this analytical
model in this work due to its advantageous analytical
properties.
The analytical solution involves a relativistic wind,
wherein at time t = t0 a slower shell with mass M0 and
Lorentz factor Γ0 starts decelerating a faster portion
of the flow characterized by a constant rest-frame mass
flux ˙M and Lorentz factor Γ1 > Γ0. Being t the observer
time, and γ = Γ/Γ1, with Γ and M being the current
Lorentz factor and mass of the slow shell. Due to the
accretion of rapidly moving material, the Lorentz factor
of the slow shell increases. When a mass element dM is
accreted, the Lorentz factor becomes
Γ + dΓ =
Γ1ΓΓ1dM + ΓM
ΓdM + Γ1M
dt Γϵc2 =
at large τ
comoving frame, t0 = M0/ ˙M, τ = t/t0, and initial γ0 =
Γ0/Γ1 . For decaying
part, γ is approximated by
γ ≃1 −
Now, we examine the spectral evolution during the
pulse decay and explore the underlying emission pro-
cesses. Following Daigne & Mochkovitch 
we consider that the dissipated energy in the system is
radiated solely through the synchrotron process. The
peak energy  is influenced by the Lorentz factor
electron Lorentz factor behind the shock . Classical
equipartition assumptions allow to express the magnetic
field and the characteristic electron Lorentz factor as
functions of the comoving density  and the dissipated
energy per unit mass . Specifically, for the standard
synchrotron radiation within internal shock model the
peak energy can be written as
Ep = Esyn ∝Γ B Γ2
e ∝Γρ1/2ϵ5/2 ∝5
γ7/2t
Ep ∝t−7/2. However, empirical observations obtained
from the best fit of the decay phase of GRB 230307A,
as shown in section 2, show that the observed spectral
evolution of pulses deviates from this steep power law
behavior at late times and decays as Ep ∝t−0.77.
To account for the observations, a more generalized
phenomenological expression for the peak energy is in-
troduced, given by Ep ∝Γρxϵy ∝
γ4x+y−1t2x
which at
later time becomes
Ep ∝
t2x+y ,
standard synchrotron values of 1/2 and 5/2, .
The values of x and y are crucial in characterizing the
observed spectral evolution of GRBs. For the case of
GRB 230307A, when x = y = 1/4, the observed peak
energy, Ep ∝1/t0.77 is reproduced.
In the following
subsection, we will investigate the significance of these
values for x and y.
We have so far investigated the behavior of spectral
evolution during pulse decay and presented a more ver-
satile expression for the peak energy, considering differ-
ent exponents to match empirical observations. Now,
we are going to show that this choice of parameters is
also consistent with the observed flux, and photon flux
of GRB 230307A, when considering the internal shock
model. The synthetic pulse profile depicted in Fig. 5 is
generated by decelerating a wind with fast shells with
Lorentz factor Γ1 = 400 and total power
erg.s−1 decelerated by slow shells with Lorentz factor
Γ0 = 100 as illustrated in section 3. The adopted values
are t0 = 0.6 s, x = y = 1/4. The pulse duration aligns
with the expectation of being approximately 27 s.
The post-maximum evolution of the flux at 6-8000
keV bandwidth exhibits a decay behavior of 1/t1.5, as
depicted in Fig. 5.
This decay pattern can be com-
prehended by employing Eq. 15, when combined with
the Lorentz gamma profile of Eq. 16. The behavior of
N ∝1/t0.44 within internal shock model is calculated
using Eq. 1 in conjunction with Eq. 15, which aligns
with the observation, N ∝1/t0.43, as shown in Fig. 5.
From our analysis, we have determined that the dis-
crepancies observed in the spectral evolution of GRB
shock model proposed in this study may stem from
oversimplified assumptions regarding the microphysics
within the emitting shocked regions. Additionally, these
discrepancies could be attributed to the nature of the
magnetic field, which may naturally decay with radius
or be influenced by the presence of an external magnetic
field Uhm & Zhang ; Zhou et al. .
internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection
and turbulence  model
The current understanding of relativistic shocks does
not offer a detailed description. However, incorporat-
ing fluctuations in the fraction of accelerated electrons
based on shock intensity allows for achieving more qual-
itative and quantitative agreement between model pre-
dictions and observed spectral evolution for many GRBs
The issues raised above may be more complex than
initially thought.
Through the use of time-resolved
spectral analysis of GECAM data, Yi et al.  have
demonstrated that the broad pulse of GRB 230307A
consists of numerous rapidly variable short pulses,
rather than being caused by short pulses overlaid on top
of a slow component. This poses a significant challenge
to the internal shock models, which attribute all vari-
ability components to collisions among different shells.
Instead, they propose the ICMART model , wherein the prompt radiation is generated
by many mini-jets resulting from local magnetic recon-
nection events in a large emission zone far from the GRB
central engine. Most notably, GRB 230307A shows the
presence of a dip at t ∼18 s in all energy bands observed
by GECAM and Fermi/GBM. During the decay phase,
significant dip with its location consistent with such a
decay phase, is allowed in the ICMART model. Because
the fast pulses originate from local mini-jet events, the
broad-band emission of the fast component is related to
the dynamics of the mini-jets and is therefore aligned in
time.
The presence of a dip and numerous rapidly variable
short pulses in the prompt emission of GRB 230307A
challenges the traditional approach to understanding the
pulse behavior of these new class of GRBs and calls
for a revision. It also emphasizes the need to consider
models other than the internal shock model to explain
such peculiar behavior. Further observations of similar
GRBs with high-resolution detectors, such as GECAM,
are necessary to draw a general conclusion.
In this paper, we presented the pulse profile of
GRB 230307A and conducted a detailed analysis of
its temporal behavior using a combined GECAM–
Fermi/GBM time-resolved spectral analysis. The inclu-
sion of GECAM data is particularly advantageous as it
effectively captured crucial information during the pile-
up period of the Fermi/GBM , showcasing its unique ability to gather
data from highly luminous GRBs.
This capability is
especially valuable in enhancing our understanding of
highly luminous GRBs, such as GRB 230307A and GRB
The analysis performed in this study is essential in val-
idating the existence of the observed hardness-intensity
correlation  and hardness-flux correlation .
These correlations are pivotal observational relations in
GRBs, as they can aid in distinguishing among different
theoretical models.
The proposed multiple shells IS scenario, as outlined
by Kobayashi et al. , displays a light curve trend
that mirrors the historical activity of the central engine.
This trend does not exhibit a dependence on shape-
energy or adhere to a power-law behavior in luminos-
ity.
This stochastic behavior is expected, considering
the random generation of the shell cluster, which pos-
sesses varied mass and velocity parameters. Achieving
precise alignment of all elements in this model is chal-
lenging due to its inherent randomness, necessitating a
highly specialized design to ensure accurate representa-
tion of the system.
We have observed that the decay phase of GRB
emission model,
in particular,
within the context
of the large-radius internal shock model , which posits continuous rel-
ativistic ejections causing shock waves to propagate
within the outflow.
However, the parameter values
x = 1/4 and y = 1/4 are lower than the expected val-
ues x = 1/2 and y = 5/2 for standard synchrotron
radiation.
This deviation suggests in the internal shock frame-
work a potential scenario where the correlation be-
tween the magnetic field, outflow Lorentz factor, elec-
tron Lorentz factor, and the dissipated energy is less pro-
nounced. As highlighted by Boˇsnjak & Daigne ,
uncertainties persist in understanding the microphysics
involved in shocked material, which could be attributed
to oversimplified assumptions about the microphysics
within the emitting shocked regions .
On the other hand, this choice of parameters
is consistent with a more general model proposed by
Uhm & Zhang , which involves a Poynting-flux-
dominated jet dissipating magnetic energy at a distance
from the engine.
In this model, the magnetic field
strength decreases with radius as the emission region
expands, and rapid bulk acceleration occurs during the
production of prompt γ-rays. Alternatively, it indicates
the possible need to incorporate additional elements,
such as a combination of a decaying shock-generated
magnetic field and a non-decaying background magnetic
field, to provide a better fit to the observations compared
to the standard internal shocks model .
On the other hand, Yi et al.  demonstrated that
the broad pulse of GRB 230307A is actually composed of
numerous rapidly variable short pulses, rather than be-
ing the result of the superposition of many short pulses
on top of a slow component. This finding aligns with the
concept of many mini-jets arising from local magnetic
reconnection events in a large emission zone far from
the GRB central engine, as proposed in the ICMART
model. This challenges the internal shock models, which
attribute all variability components to collisions among
different shells. Consequently, it is not surprising that
the internal shock model for this GRB requires ad hoc
assumptions in order to provide an acceptable pulse ex-
planation.
An area requiring further investigation in the internal
shock model is the reliability of the initial Lorentz fac-
tor profile. For example, it is becoming increasingly ac-
cepted that the kinetic energy of ejecta in GRBs is pow-
ered by the rotational energy of the central engine. How-
ever, the utilization of rotational energy-powered ejecta
results in a reduction of the overall rotational energy of
the central engine, consequently leading to a smaller ini-
tial kinetic energy for the remaining ejecta. As a conse-
quence, this affects the temporal decrease of the Lorentz
gamma factor of the ejecta , raising concerns
about the validity of the initial profile employed in the
internal shock model, which highly relies on the decel-
eration of rapidly moving materials by slower materials
within a relativistic wind.
