We investigate the 1D plane-parallel front connecting the warm  and hot  phases of
the circumgalactic medium , focusing on the influence of cosmic rays  in shaping these
transition layers. We find that cosmic rays dictate the thermal balance while other fluxes  adjust to compensate. We compute column density ratios
for selected transition temperature ions and compare them with observational data. While most of
our models fail to reproduce the observations, a few are successful, although we make no claims for
their uniqueness. Some of the discrepancies may indicate challenges in capturing the profiles in cooler,
photoionized regions, as has been suggested for by previous efforts to model thermal transition layers.
The circumgalactic medium , a gaseous halo
enveloping galactic disks, acts as both a reservoir for
star formation and a repository for galactic outflows and
feedback processes. Its multiphase structure, character-
ized by regions of varying temperatures and densities,
retains the imprints of the galaxy’s formation and evo-
lutionary history. Investigating the CGM is crucial for
understanding the baryon cycle in galaxies, as it reg-
ulates the flow of gas between the galaxy and the in-
tergalactic medium, thereby influencing star formation
rates and the effectiveness of feedback processes .
Recent observational and theoretical studies have sig-
nificantly advanced our understanding of the CGM. Ob-
servations using metal absorption lines, such as those
from O VI, C IV, and Mg II, have unveiled the complex
multiphase nature of the CGM, highlighting substantial
variations in temperature, density, and ionization states
across different regions . Discrepancies between observed line
ratios and model predictions indicate the necessity for

terpret CGM properties. Efforts to address these dis-
crepancies include considering radiative cooling flows
that incorporate gas dynamics and self-photoionization,
turbulent mixing layers where Kelvin-Helmholtz insta-
bilities create intermediate-temperature regions around
clouds, conductive interfaces where cool clouds evapo-
rate and hot gas condenses at the surface due to heat
conduction, and ionized gas behind radiative shocks po-
tentially produced by strong galactic winds .
An important aspect of the CGM is the influence of
cosmic rays .
CRs provide additional pressure
support, affect thermal balance, and may drive galac-
tic winds, all of which shape the overall structure and
evolution of the CGM. Their ability to propagate over
vast distances and recoup their losses by extracting en-
ergy from ambient shocks and turbulence allows CRs to
impact regions far from their origin, influencing the ther-
mal and dynamical properties of the CGM on a larger
scale . How-
ever, in the absence of observational evidence for cosmic
rays in the CGM, we can only speculate upon their in-
fluence. And because direct detection of cosmic rays in
diffuse environments such as the CGM is challenging, we

must resort to observational predictions based on mod-
eling the thermal gas itself.
The transfer of momentum and energy between cos-
mic rays and thermal gas is mediated by magnetic field
structures on a scale of order the cosmic ray gyroradius.
These small-scale magnetic structures could be part of
an extrinsic turbulent cascade, but can also be driven by
the cosmic rays themselves via the so-called streaming
instability . The latter case is
known as cosmic ray self confinement, and we will as-
sume throughout this paper that it holds. An interesting
consequence of the theory is that it breaks down if the
projections of the cosmic ray pressure gradient and ther-
mal plasma density gradient along the background mag-
netic field oppose each other. In this case - as predicted
from analytical arguments by Skilling  and shown
first in a simulation by Wiener et al. , scattering
disappears, the cosmic rays decouple from the gas, and
their pressure becomes constant. Such transport bottle-
necks should be common in the CGM, with its clumpy
density structure, provided the clumps are magnetically
connected to the Galactic disk, where most cosmic rays
presumably originate.
Bottlenecks were studied in a series of papers of in-
creasing generality in Wiener et al. ; Bus-
tard & Zweibel ; Tsung et al. . These works
showed that the large CR pressure gradient accelerates
cool clouds upward, imparting significant momentum
and causing changes in gas density and temperature pro-
files.
Additionally, CRs were found to pressurize the
cold gas, reducing its density and heating the cloud’s
surface, leading to broader transition layers and altering
ion abundances. These findings underscore the signifi-
cant role of CRs in shaping the thermal and dynamical
properties of the CGM. Due to the disparity in scale
between the assumed cloud size and the front thickness,
the transition region has only been modeled previously
as a 1D structure in a steady state .
The transition layers between the cool and hot phases,
characterized by a density contrast typically around a
factor of 100 as temperatures shift from 104 K to 106 K,
are particularly affected by CRs. Models of these tran-
sition layers are crucial not only for explaining observed
line ratios but as was shown in ,
may also be indicators of clouds dominated by cosmic
ray pressure. This dominance would signify that CRs
are a significant component of the galactic structure, af-
fecting both the local environment of the CGM and the
broader galactic ecosystem; it would also be evidence for
the theory of cosmic ray self confinement.
In this study, we refine the 1D plane-parallel symmet-
ric model presented by Wiener et al.  by incor-
porating thermal conduction and gas flow in the energy
equation in addition to cosmic ray heating and radiative
cooling. These additions aim to broaden the range of
cosmic ray-mediated front models and provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the CGM’s structure
and dynamics.
The plan of this paper is as follows. In §§2.1, we briefly
review some well-known front models. In §§2.2 we for-
mulate the problem, with a separate discussion of the
boundary conditions in §§2.3. Section 3 gives detailed
discussions of two types of front, static  and evap-
orative .
We show the effects of changing the
background magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure in
the cloud in §4. In §5 we compute the column densities
of several transition temperature ions across our range
of front models and compare their ratios to the ratios
derived by Wakker et al.  from absorption line
spectroscopy. Section 6 summarizes and discusses our
main conclusions. Appendix A is a short discussion of
condensation fronts. Appendix B shows some results on
how the column densities of transition temperature ions
depend on domain over which we integrate.
Past work on fronts without cosmic rays provides valu-
able context for understanding the distinct role of CRs
in gas dynamics. Cowie & McKee  investigated
evaporative fronts in the interstellar medium, where
thermal conduction from a surrounding hot medium
drives the continuous evaporation of cooler gas clouds.
Their model established a steady-state balance between
thermal conduction and enthalpy flux as the heating and
cooling terms, respectively, with mass being lost from
the cool phase to the hot phase. They also demonstrated
how the geometry of the system influences the stability
and evolution of these fronts. Inoue et al.  later
examined phase transition layers connecting two ther-
mal equilibrium phases, a cold neutral medium cooled
by C II and a warm neutral medium cooled by Lyα,
with heating provided by photoelectrons from dust. Be-
cause both studies solved for temperature assuming en-
ergy balance and heat transfer by classical conduction1
they were treated as two-point boundary value prob-
lems.
In Cowie & McKee , the temperature of
the hot medium was chosen based on observations and
the cloud temperature was approximated by zero. In-
does not follow Fick’s Law, but that is immaterial for our purposes.
Cosmic Ray Mediated Thermal Fronts
oue et al.  set the boundary temperatures to their
equilibrium values.
In Wiener et al. , thermal conduction and en-
thalpy flux were dropped, leaving collisionless cosmic
ray heating supplemented by a base heating rate per
particle to balance radiative cooling. Without heat con-
duction, the energy equation was reduced to first or-
der. The models were integrated outward for 100 pc, at
which point T had typically increased from its chosen
value of 104 K at the cloud boundary to a few 106 K.
Over this temperature range it was not possible to find
a reasonable high-temperature thermal equilibrium, so
the model was solved as an initial value problem and the
temperature was still increasing at the 100 pc cutoff. It
was checked a posteriori that the fronts found from the
model were too thick for heat transport by thermal con-
duction to play a significant role. We expand on this
issue in §3.
The evolution equations governing a thermal gas de-
scribe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.
In 1D, they are:

respectively; vA is the Alfv´en velocity B/√4πρ; Pg and
Eg denote the thermal pressure and total energy density
of the gas, with

κT stands for the thermal conduction coefficient, and ρL
is the net cooling function. For simplicity, we assume a
fully ionized Hydrogen plasma and an ideal gas equation
of state, and take γg = 5/3 throughout.
We use a net cooling function ρL ≡n2Λ −nΓ. We
adopt Γ = 1×10−26 erg/s, consistent with the value used
in . Because of the sharp cooling drop-
off near T = 104 K, this choice of Γ allows for thermal
equilibrium at both T ∼104 K and T ∼106 K. We note
that this value of Γ is higher than the lower limit set by

In the fluid approximation, cosmic rays are governed
by the energy equation :
resents the CR energy flux:
Fc = γcPc −κc
The influence of cosmic rays is manifested through
the cosmic ray pressure  gradient term in the mo-
mentum equation and the heating term in the energy
equation.
As shown in Wiener et al. ; Zweibel
the transfer of cosmic ray energy to Alfv´en waves due
to the streaming instability together with the transfer of
wave energy to the thermal background, as must occur
in a steady state. The pressure gradient force represents
momentum transfer between the cosmic rays and the
magnetic field fluctuations, and occurs whether cosmic
rays are self confined or confined by extrinsic turbulence.
We seek steady state solutions of Equations  - 
under the further simplifying assumptions that cosmic
ray diffusion is negligible and v/vA ≪1. That is, we
set all time derivatives to zero, drop κc, and wherever
v + vA appears, we replace it by vA. This leads to the
following three conserved quantities:
ρv = constant,
ρv2 + Pg + Pc = constant,
Pc/ργc/2 = constant.

From equations 8 we obtain the following relationship
between number density  and temperature :

where the “0” subscripts denote initial values. This al-
lows us to treat T as a function of n. We then recast
eqn.  as a second order ordinary differential equation

variables. The boundary values are established within
the warm ionized medium, as detailed in Section 2.3.
In the warm ionized medium on the left boundary
number density  of 0.1 cm−3. The initial temper-
ature  is established at 104 K, leading to an initial
gas pressure  of 1.38 × 10−13 erg/cm3.
These boundary conditions are chosen to represent typi-
cal conditions in the warm ionized medium of the CGM.
In this environment, the thermal conduction coefficient
is given by κT = 5.6 × 10−7T 5/2 erg/s/K/cm .
In our fiducial case, we adopt a constant magnetic
field strength B = 3 µG and assume the field is per-
pendicular to the plane of the front. This choice aligns
with observations of the ∼µG magnetic field strength
in the CGM .
For the evaporative solutions, we set the gas velocity
at the boundary  to 400 m/s, neglecting the effects of
any relative motion between the cloud and the ambient
medium. The positive value of the mass flux corresponds
to the warm medium evaporating into the hot medium.
We also explore the scenario with a static front, where
v = 0. We show in Appendix A that a condensation
front cannot form under these conditions. In our setup,
we have vA ≫v, which satisfies the condition for the
validity of Equation 3. In our fiducial case, we assume
Pc,0 = 2Pg,0 ), but the
initial ratio of CR pressure to gas pressure is a parameter
we vary; we introduce the parameter α ≡Pc,0/Pg,0 + 1.
We list all relevant parameters in Table 1.
We proceed by solving the energy equation , reformulated as a second-order initial value
problem for n, imposing two boundary conditions: n0 =

In Wiener et al.  the front models are generated

In this section, we first examine the simpler static

pressure  profiles for a static front system, where
the velocity v = 0 and only thermal conduction, cosmic ray
heating, and radiative cooling interact. The profiles are dif-
ferentiated by the initial gradients of number density, dn
across a range from 10−14 to 10−17 cm−4.
We emphasize
that except for the initial gradients, all profiles originate from
the same initial conditions. The top panel shows the num-
ber density profiles, where steeper initial gradients lead to
a more rapid decline in number density from the origin. In
contrast, the less steep initial gradients see a substantial and
sharp decrease around ∼1 pc, indicating a delayed transi-
tion. The middle panel shows the corresponding temperature
profiles. The different profiles underscore the significant im-
pact of the initial gradient on the structure of the front. The
bottom panel illustrates the pressure profiles; while the ini-
tial cosmic ray pressure is twice that of the gas pressure, it
gradually decreases as the density drops.
tinguished by their initial gradients of number density,
the models are initialized with cosmic ray pressure dom-
inant , and all become gas pressure domi-
nated at large distances, typically by about an order of
magnitude. This is due to the polytropic relationship
between Pc and ρ, whereas the decrease in ρ is compen-
sated by an increase in T. As shown in Figure 1, steeper

imply stronger influences from thermal conduction and
cosmic ray heating, resulting in a noticeable and imme-

contrast, profiles with less steep initial gradients , only show a significant decrease in
number density at ∼1 pc, indicating a delayed transi-
tion. Regardless of the initial gradient, the number den-
sity always decreases to of order 10−3 cm−3 at x = 100
pc, with the steepest gradient reaching ∼1×10−3 cm−3
and the least steep gradient dropping to ∼3 × 10−3
cm−3. The same behavior is observed in the temper-
ature profiles in the middle panel of Figure 1. Lower

In Figure 2, we show the contributions of each flux
component as a function of distance.
In the steepest
initial gradient case, cosmic ray heating is consistently
offset by conductive cooling. When dn
cosmic ray heating decreases to be smaller than radia-
tive cooling, radiative cooling is then countered by CR
heating and conductive heating. This balance contin-
ues all the way to the boundary at x = 100 pc. It is
not surprising that all these models require conductive
cooling near the cloud, since the gradient required to
balance cosmic ray heating with radiative cooling is of
order 10−21 cm−4, much smaller than any of the models
presented here.
Comparing our static front results with previous work
highlights the influence of cosmic rays on the energy
balance.
In Cowie & McKee , without cosmic
rays, conductive heating balances radiative cooling at
the front. In contrast, when cosmic rays are included,
as in our model and Wiener et al. , cosmic ray
heating becomes the dominant process balancing radia-
tive cooling. Nonetheless, thermal conduction remains
significant, as strong cosmic ray heating requires con-
ductive cooling to dissipate the excess energy. Our re-
sult highlights the crucial role of thermal conduction in
maintaining thermal equilibrium within the system.

Flux Gradient

Contributions of each flux component as a function of distance in the static case, in solid and dashed lines in
erg cm−3s−1. This figure delineates the varying dynamics between different flux components under different initial number
density gradients. For smaller initial number density gradients, cosmic ray heating first is balanced by conductive cooling,
until it decreases to the level of radiative cooling, which is when conduction becomes less dominant heating term. For larger
initial gradients, the transition from conductive cooling to heating occurs over a more extended distance . The
interplay between these components is critical to understanding the thermal dynamics of the system.
In this section, we incorporate an evaporative flow into
the energy equation:
γg −1Pgv −κT
the resulting number density, temperature, and pres-
sure profiles in Figure 3.
For comparison, the static
front cases are shown with dashed lines. Notably, the
profiles of the evaporation fronts begin to deviate from
those of the static case beyond 0.1 pc, with these devi-
ations amplifying with increasing distance. Specifically,
the number density in the evaporation front scenario
drops more significantly compared to the static case,
which corresponds to a greater increase in temperature.
The pressure profiles show that as we move away from
the origin, the cosmic ray  and gas pressure profiles
evolve similarly to the static front case. However, after
the point where Pc = Pg, the difference between Pc and
Pg becomes greater compared to the static front sce-
nario, indicating a sharper transition between the roles
of CR pressure and gas pressure. The presence of flow
introduces dynamical pressure, which is absent in the
static case.
In the evaporation scenario, the pressure
profile shows a continuous decrease in the sum of CR and
gas pressures, accompanied by an increase in dynamical
pressure. However, the dynamical pressure remains rel-
atively small, accounting for only about 3% of the total
pressure at x = 100 pc, emphasizing the dominant role
of CR and gas pressures in shaping the dynamics of the
layer.
We also present the contributions of each flux com-
ponent as a function of distance in Figure 4. For less
steep initial gradients , we
identify three distinct regions.
Near the origin, cos-
mic ray  heating is the dominant process and is
balanced by conductive cooling. Further from the ori-
gin, there is a transition region where CR heating de-
creases to levels comparable to radiative cooling, caus-
ing conduction to shift from cooling to heating. This
transition indicates a regime where CR heating is bal-
anced by radiative cooling. Beyond this point, as ra-
diative cooling reaches its maximum and subsequently
declines, conductive heating and enthalpy flux cooling
become the dominant processes, similar to the Cowie &
McKee evaporation fronts. For steeper initial gradients
nificantly. Strong CR heating prevents radiative cooling
from fully balancing the thermal energy input, leading to
the absence of a region where radiative cooling balances
CR heating and thereby precluding the formation of re-
gions with flat number density and temperature profiles.
Cosmic Ray Mediated Thermal Fronts
These results underscore the complex interplay between
CR heating, radiative cooling, and conduction in regu-
lating the thermal dynamics of the system.
In this section, we examine the effects of chang-
ing physical parameters, specifically the magnetic field
strength and the ratio between cosmic ray pressure
and gas pressure at the x = 0 boundary, denoted as
α ≡Pc,0/Pg,0 + 1.
The magnetic field strength ap-
pears only as a multiplier in the cosmic ray heating term.
Meanwhile, the ratio α sets the initial cosmic ray pres-
sure and also determines the system’s total pressure,
with a higher α indicating increased initial CR pressure
and total pressure.
We investigate how variations in
these parameters impact the dynamics and structure of
the layer.
In this subsection, we discuss the results for α = 10.
With this higher value, at the x = 100 pc boundary,
the number density does not drop as low, reaching only
temperature profile is smaller, however.
Additionally,
the role of dynamical pressure across the layer becomes
much less significant.
At the x = 100 pc boundary,
dynamical pressure constitutes only 0.8% of the total
pressure, in contrast to the α = 3 case, where dynami-
cal pressure at the same boundary is comparable to CR
pressure.
Examining the component plot  reveals the
impact of α. For dn
ing at the origin extends the distance needed for conduc-
tion to change from cooling to heating. This difference
is illustrated in the top two panels of Figure 6. We also
observe that for dn
sity gradient, and hence the temperature gradient, are
steeper than their α = 3 counterparts . Additionally, after the peak in radiative
cooling, the α = 10 scenarios require a longer distance
for radiative cooling and CR heating to fall to levels
similar to enthalpy flux and conduction. This extended
distance is reflected in the more gradual changes in the
number density and temperature profiles in this region.
The component plots demonstrate how the strength of
CR heating at the origin impacts the system’s thermal
structure and the spatial extent of physical processes.
These observations are similar to the α = 3 case, where
the presence of CR heating leads to the adjustment of
other terms in the energy equations to counteract CR
heating.

Flux Gradient 
Figure 4. Contributions of each flux component as a function of distance in the fiducial case. The thin, semi-transparent
lines show the flux magnitude for the static scenario. For initial gradients less steep than 10−16 cm−4, three distinct phases are
identified: close to the origin, cosmic ray heating dominates and is counterbalanced by conductive cooling; at an intermediate
distance, a transition to conductive heating occurs as cosmic ray heating balances radiative cooling; and beyond, where conduc-
tive heating dominates against declining radiative cooling. For steeper initial gradients , CR heating is so
strong that radiative cooling cannot balance it, precluding the formation of regions with flat number density and temperature
profiles.
We now investigate the impact of a heightened mag-
netic field strength, B, set to 30 µG. Note that when
only B is adjusted, the total pressure of the system re-
mains the same; only the cosmic ray heating term in-
creases by a factor of 10. With this stronger magnetic
field, achieving number density and temperature profiles
as steep as in previous cases requires steeper initial num-
ber density gradients. This change is clearly shown in
Figure 7. A key difference between the B = 30µG result
and the α = 10 result is that, with constant total pres-
sure, the temperature does not reach ∼106 K, as it does
in the fiducial case and in the α = 10 case. Similarly,
the enhanced magnetic field reduces the relative impor-
tance of dynamical pressure compared to the trend in
the fiducial case .
Turning to Figure 8, we see that a tenfold increase
in the magnetic field strength causes CR heating to de-
crease more rapidly, aligning more quickly with radia-
tive cooling levels. For all initial density gradients, by
x = 100 pc, the relatively smaller decrease in number
density compared to the fiducial case means that en-
thalpy flux cooling and conductive heating are no longer
the dominant processes. Instead, CR heating and radia-
tive cooling become dominant at the x = 100 pc bound-
ary. This sustained dominance of CR heating and ra-
diative cooling at larger scales is a direct outcome of the
stronger magnetic field’s influence on the system.
It may seem paradoxical that increasing B, and with
it vA, increases the heating rate but decreases T far
from the cloud. We can understand this by observing
that as B increases, so does the range over which cosmic
ray heating is balanced by conductive cooling. This in
turn requires that T cannot increase too quickly. For
example, it can readily be shown that if T has a power
law dependence on position, T ∝xp, conductive cooling
requires p < 2/7. This accounts for the relatively slow
increase in T in the high magnetic field models.
We use the ionization fractions Xi from Gnat &
Sternberg  and the relative abundances AX from
Asplund et al.  to compute the column densities of
specific ions. The column density for each ion is defined
by NX = AX

sity, and the integral is across the front, up to a distance
of 100 pc. We discuss this choice of integration bound-
ary in Appendix B. We then compare our calculated

tial shortcomings in the current models.
We compute the column densities for CIV, OVI, and
SiIV, and derive the diagnostic line ratios SiIV/CIV,
CIV/OVI, and NV/OVI. These ratios serve as key in-
dicators for understanding the ionization processes and
thermal structure within the interstellar medium. The
SiIV/CIV ratio probes cooler, photoionized gas with
temperatures in the range of 104 −105 K, primarily
indicating regions where UV radiation dominates the
ionization processes . In contrast, the CIV/OVI ratio spans the
transition between photoionized and hotter, collisionally
ionized gas, typically found at temperatures between
fying multiphase structures within the ISM, often trac-
ing shock-heated gas in more dynamic regions . Finally, the NV/OVI ratio
is sensitive to collisionally ionized gas in the warm-hot
ionized medium , making it a useful diagnostic
for gas in intermediate ionization states and the pres-
ence of shock-heated or disturbed gas .

dependent SiIV/CIV ratio versus CIV/OVI ratio in

Addition-
ally, we include a CR heating balancing radiative cool-
ing model, as discussed in Wiener et al. , shown
in orange.
Our results reveal that most of the models lie well
outside the observational range in the SiIV/CIV versus
CIV/OVI parameter space. The highest magnetic field
sistent with the observations; however, these models si-
multaneously predict CIV/OVI ratios that are too high
compared to the observational data. In contrast, mod-
els with lower magnetic field values produce SiIV/CIV
ratios that are significantly lower than those observed in
the HVCs.
Similarly, in the right panel, the high B value models
systematically overestimate the NV/OVI ratio, placing
them outside the range of observational constraints. For
the other models, those with the largest dn
mate the CIV/OVI ratio, suggesting that the structure
and dynamics of the gas in these models may be in-
sufficient to fully capture the physical processes driving
the ionization conditions. However, the range of mod-
els that overlap the data plotted in  space is quite large, suggesting that this is not a par-
ticularly sensitive diagnostic of conditions in the front,
including the initial value of the density gradient.
A prima facie interpretation of these results suggests
that if a model lies within the observational range in
the NV/OVI versus CIV/OVI parameter space but fails
to reproduce the correct SiIV/CIV ratio, it implies that
the model is better at predicting the ionization profile for
gas in the 105−106 K temperature range than for cooler
gas at 104 −105 K. This also indicates that the model
more accurately captures conditions dominated by col-
lisional ionization rather than photoionization. These
discrepancies highlight potential limitations in the cur-
rent model framework, particularly regarding the role
of magnetic fields and cosmic ray heating in shaping
the ionization state of the ISM and CGM. In fact, the
line ratios are not well fit by previous models which do
not include cosmic rays ). Our α = 1 models, as shown in Figure 9, align
with this finding.
It should not be overlooked, however, that some of our
models do successfully reproduce both pairs of line ra-
tios. As might be expected from the forgoing discussion,
these are the models with intermediate field strength;
B = 20µG for α = 3. As we already noted, the fits are
relatively insensitive to the initial density gradient dn
which sets the initial cosmic ray heating rate and which

we regard as the least well-determined parameter in our
models.
In this paper, we explored the evolution of the tran-
sition layer between warm  and hot  gas
phases in the circumgalactic medium by integrating the
energy equation  as an initial value prob-
lem. We showed that cosmic ray heating, thermal con-
duction, radiative cooling, enthalpy flux, and dynamical
pressure collectively shape the temperature and density
profiles of the transition layer. At large distances from
the cloud, we found that conduction is the main heat
source, and that it can be balanced by an outward en-
thalpy flux, as in the models of Cowie & McKee .
We also found that the temperature and density pro-
files across the front are quite sensitive to the value we
adopt for the initial density gradient. When the gradient
is sufficiently small, radiative cooling suffices to balance
cosmic ray heating as assumed in the front models of
Wiener et al. .
For sufficiently large gradients,
cosmic ray heating is balanced by conductive cooling.
In view of this sensitivity, we have to ask what controls
this ratio in a natural environment. While addressing
this question is beyond the scope of this paper, we spec-
ulate that the answer lies either in the front formation
process or in the stability of the front to small pertur-
bations. These possibilities will be examined in future
work.
Our findings emphasize the dominant role that cosmic
rays can play in regulating the structure of the transition

Solid lines represent the heightened magnetic field scenario, while thin, semi-transparent lines depict the flux contributions for
a magnetic field strength of 3 µG. The plot shows a more rapid decline in CR heating, aligning more quickly with radiative
cooling levels. Additionally, beyond the cooling function peak, CR heating and radiative cooling remain the dominant processes
due to the smaller decline in number density.

CR heating + radiative cooling
Figure 9. Left panel: SiIV/CIV versus CIV/OVI ratios in logarithmic scale, compared with observational data from Wakker
et al.  . Right panel: NV/OVI versus CIV/OVI ratios, similarly overlaid with observational
data. Colored shapes denote our model predictions, with variations in magnetic field strengths and cosmic ray parameters. The
orange shapes represent models where CR heating balances radiative cooling, following Wiener et al. . Both panels reveal
discrepancies between the models and observations, particularly in the SiIV/CIV versus CIV/OVI space, where no models fit
within the observed range. High magnetic field models match SiIV/CIV but overestimate CIV/OVI, while lower field models
miss SiIV/CIV but align with CIV/OVI and NV/OVI. This suggests that in general, the models are more accurate at higher
temperatures but struggle with cooler, photoionized conditions. Note that models with intermediate field strength, B = 20µG,
do overlap the date on both plots, although we make no claim to their uniqueness.
layer between the warm and hot gas phases of the CGM.
The addition of CR heating in these models dictates the
thermal balance, with the other flux terms adjusting
accordingly to balance CR heating.
These effects are
sensitive to the magnetic field strength and the ratio of
CR to gas pressure  at the warm gas boundary.
Our analysis of ion column density ratios shows that
while our model predictions align with some observa-

tional data, and some represent successful fits, discrep-
ancies persist.
Only the highest magnetic field mod-
els reproduce the observed SiIV/CIV ratios, but they
overestimate the CIV/OVI ratios.
Conversely, other
models underestimate the SiIV/CIV ratios, although
some fall within the observed range for CIV/OVI and
NV/OVI. The agreement with CIV/OVI and NV/OVI,
but not with SiIV/CIV, suggests that these models bet-
ter represent ionization conditions at higher tempera-
tures , where collisional ionization dom-
inates, but struggle to capture the profiles in cooler,
photoionized regions. These discrepancies indicate that
while CR heating significantly influences the ionization
structure of the CGM, additional processes such as tur-
bulent mixing, shocks, or self-ionization may be neces-
sary to fully explain the observed line ratios in lower
temperature regimes.
The need to include such ef-
fects would be particularly compelling if magnetic field
strengths as high as 20µG  could be ruled
out.
In addition to the influence of cosmic rays, our study
highlights the crucial role of thermal conduction in
maintaining energy balance within the transition layers.
Thermal conduction dissipates excess heat from cosmic
ray interactions, preventing runaway heating and stabi-
lizing the temperature profiles.
Overall, our findings reinforce the notion that the
CGM is a complex and dynamic environment where a
variety of physical processes, e.g. cosmic ray heating,
radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and gas flows, in-
teract to shape its structure and ionization state. Future
work will focus on investigating the stability of these
transition layers, particularly in the presence of cos-
mic ray pressure, magnetic fields, and thermal conduc-
tion. Studying the onset and development of instabili-
ties within these fronts will be crucial for understanding
their behavior.

A. CONDENSATION FRONT
From the momentum conservation equation  in the steady-state case , we have:
pressure.
Differentiating the equation, we have:
dρ = 2
dρ > 0. Therefore, a monotonically decreasing density ρ corresponds to a
monotonically decreasing pressure P.
This relationship implies that the flow cannot proceed from the hot medium to the cold medium. Specifically, in a
scenario where the density is monotonically decreasing as the gas transitions from the cold to the hot medium, the
corresponding pressure must also decrease. Consequently, gas flow is driven in the direction of decreasing pressure,
which means it cannot move from the hot medium to the cold medium.
B. SENSITIVITY OF LINE RATIOS TO INTEGRATION CUTOFFS
The line ratios we presented are sensitive to the cutoff point chosen for the integration over the transition layer.
In Figure 10, we plot the line ratios , log, and log) as functions of temperature
where the integration is cut off, with the shaded regions representing the range of observational data. The vertical
lines indicate the temperature at x = 100 pc for the two models: the red vertical line corresponds to the temperature
for the model with dn

As seen in Figure 10, the choice of temperature cutoff has a significant, nontrivial effect on the calculated line ratios.
Wiener et al.  used a cutoff at 2 × 106 K, which aligns more closely with the converged values in the higher-
temperature regime, compared to cutting off at 100 pc for the red model. However, while extending the integration
to higher temperatures may yield more stable line ratios, the physical thickness of the transition layers becomes an
important consideration. The models suggest that line ratios converge at higher temperatures, but the temperature at
x = 100 pc remains well below this threshold for both models. This highlights a key issue: while we can theoretically
integrate to very high temperatures, the question remains whether the transition layers are actually that thick in reality.
Currently, we lack observational probes that can resolve the full extent of these layers. This uncertainty underscores
the need for careful definition of the integration boundaries and comparison across models and observations.
