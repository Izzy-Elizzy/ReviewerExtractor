The explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova is a complex interplay between neutrino heating and cooling , the gravitational potential, and the ram pressure of the infalling material. To analyze the
post-bounce phase of a supernova, one can use the generalized Force Explosion Condition , which succinctly formalizes
the interplay among these four phenomena in an analytical condition, consistent with realistic simulations. In this paper, we
use the FEC+ to study the post-bounce phase of 341 spherically symmetric simulations, where convection is included through
a time-dependent mixing length approach. We find that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the expanding shock can
significantly change the outcome of the supernova by driving the FEC+ above the explosion threshold. We systematically explore
this by  artificially smoothing the pre-supernova density profile, and  artificially varying the mixing length. In both cases,
we find that large-enough density contrasts at the Si/O interface lead to successful shock revival only if the FEC+ is already close
to the explosion threshold. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of the Si/O interface has a substantial effect on the critical
condition for supernova explosions, contributing between 5% and 15%, depending on how pronounced the density contrast at
the interface is. Earlier studies showed that convection affects the critical condition by 25–30%, which demonstrates that the
accretion of the Si/O interface through the shock can play a nearly comparable role in influencing shock dynamics.

The explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova  has
been the topic of many decades of research . Theoretical, observational, and computational efforts
have shed light onto this complex phenomenon, and the theoretical
understanding of the explosion of a CCSN has drastically improved in
the last decade, thanks to the rapid improvement of supercomputers
and, therefore, of detailed simulations .
Nonetheless, the detailed mechanism of the CCSN explosion is
still a matter of active research. Understanding the physical phe-
nomena that lead to an explosion has important consequences in a
variety of astrophysical environments. Knowing which stars explode
and which ones fail determines the distribution of compact objects in
the Universe . It also determines the thermody-
namic conditions that lead to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements,
which in turn determines the chemical enrichment of the interstellar
medium . Finally, understand-
ing the physical phenomena responsible for triggering the explosion
can unveil what are the pre-collapse features that are important for
the explosion or the failed shock revival .
The first breakthrough in studying the CCSN explosion mecha-
nism was made by Colgate & White , who suggested that
neutrinos were responsible for carrying energy from the deep in-
terior of the central proto-neutron star  to the vicinity of the
shock. Later, Bethe & Wilson  refined this picture by introduc-
ing the so-called "delayed neutrino mechanism". In their simulations,
neutrinos take a few hundred milliseconds after the bounce to trans-
fer enough energy to revive the shock. During this period, the shock
stalls at a nearly constant radius. However, with more advanced mod-
els for describing the state of matter at supranuclear densities and
interactions between neutrinos and matter , the explosion could not be obtained in spherical sym-
metry anymore. The reason is the lack of multi-dimensional effects,
and state-of-the-art multidimensional simulations indeed show self-
consistent explosions . In particular, in the last two decades neutrino-driven convec-
tion has been shown to play a crucial role for the explosion dynamics
the development of parametric models to include neutrino driven
convection and turbulent dissipation effects in spherically symmet-
ric, 1D simulations. These parametric models are known as 1D+
simulations and over the years, they were able to produce successful
explosions .
The advantage of such models is that they are computationally very
affordable, and therefore allow for systematic studies of the explosion
mechanism itself. One of the first attempts at deriving an explosion
condition was the seminal work of Burrows & Goshy , who
derived a critical luminosity condition based on the idea that, given
a mass accretion rate, there is a maximum neutrino luminosity above
which a stalled shock solution is not realizable, and therefore an
explosion can develop. Similar studies were later carried out over the
years , oftentimes guided
by the results of multi-dimensional simulations.
Recently, a few studies 
have pointed out that the magnitude of the density drop located near
the Si/O interface can be used to predict the outcome of the explo-
sion. Even before these studies, the idea that the accretion of the Si/O
interface onto the shock could facilitate the explosion was well es-
tablished . Because of the sudden change in composition,
there is usually a large density drop at the Si/O interface that, when
accreted through the shock, leads to a sudden drop in ram pressure,
facilitating a rapid shock expansion that, under the right conditions,
can turn into a runaway explosion.
In this paper, we will analyze how the accretion onto the shock
of the density drop, which typically occurs near the Si/O interface,
affects the explosion. In particular, this manuscript is structured as
follows: in Section 2.1 we describe the FEC+, in Section 2.2 we
discuss the accretion of the Si/O interface through the shock, and
in Section 2.3 we describe our numerical setup. Then, in Section 3
we analyze the explosion of 341 1D+ simulations, and in Section
magnitude of the density drop at the Si/O interface change the FEC+
and therefore the explosion. Finally, we discuss the results in Section
Over the years many have suggested explosion criteria for success-
ful CCSN explosions . Over
three decades ago, Burrows & Goshy  pointed out that the
stalled shock phase is a steady-state, boundary-value problem. They
parameterized this problem by the neutrino luminosity, 𝐿𝜈, and mass
accretion rate, ¤𝑀, and they found a critical curve in these parameters,
below which stalled shock solutions exist and above this critical curve
there are no steady-state solutions. They suggested that the solutions
above this critical curve are most likely explosive.
Inspired by the insight of Burrows & Goshy , Murphy &
Dolence  utilized semi-analytic techniques to propose an in-
tegral condition for supernova explosions. This work suggests that
the dimensional integral of the momentum equation, denoted as Ψ,
is helpful for determining the existence of stalled-shock solutions.
The relationship between the shock velocity and the parameter Ψ
indicates that a stalled solution exists if Ψ = 0. This force explosion
condition is consistent with critical neutrino luminosity conditions
and one-dimensional simulations and implies that more factors than
just neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate influence explosion
dynamics. They show that the integral explosion condition corre-
sponds to a critical hypersurface where the physical dimensions are
𝐿𝜈, 𝑀NS, 𝑅NS, and ¤𝑀.
Gogilashvili & Murphy  derived an analytic model for
the force explosion condition, beginning with fundamental hydro-
dynamic equations and identifying that the explosion condition de-
pends on two dimensionless parameters instead of four dimensional
parameters. The force explosion condition  is expressed as:
power normalized by accretion power, and ˜𝜅= 𝜅¤𝑀/
𝐺𝑀NS𝑅NS is
a dimensionless neutrino opacity. The coefficients 𝑎and 𝑏mostly
depend upon the density profile of the material behind the shock and
can be estimated analytically to be 𝑎∼0.05 and 𝑏∼0.51. It is
crucial to emphasize that the theory provides an analytic functional
form of the FEC. While the coefficients can be estimated analytically,
these estimates might not be accurate due to the approximations and
assumptions of the model and thus might need proper calibration
with CCSN simulations.
The validity of the FEC has been checked through three ap-
proaches. Gogilashvili & Murphy  first, compared the FEC
with the semi-analytic condition of Burrows & Goshy , leading
to a numerical fit for 𝑎= 0.06 and 𝑏= 0.38, which closely matched
their analytical estimates. Second, they demonstrated that the FEC
accurately predicts explosion conditions in one-dimensional light-
bulb simulations. In follow-up research, Gogilashvili et al. 
adapted the FEC for simulations using actual neutrino transport,
such as those conducted with the GR1D code . Their tests confirmed that the FEC reliably pre-
dicts explosion conditions in spherically symmetric supernova sim-
ulations, highlighting its robustness as a diagnostic tool.
Motivated by the accuracy of the spherical force explosion condi-
tion, Gogilashvili et al.  generalized the FEC to incorporate
multi-dimensional effects such as neutrino-driven convection and
turbulent dissipation in a simple model. This generalized condition,
termed FEC+, is expressed as
𝑊𝑏𝑅NS/, representing the dimensionless buoyant driv-
ing, and ˜𝑅𝑟𝑟= 𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑅NS/, representing the dimensionless
Reynolds stress. These additional terms 
reduce the net neutrino heating required for explosion by 26%, a re-
duction consistent with published studies . This finding high-
lights the significance of multi-dimensional effects in supernova ex-
plosion dynamics. Consequently, the FEC+ offers a more compre-
hensive and accurate framework for describing the explodability of
multi-dimensional simulations, enhancing our understanding of the
underlying physical processes.
As mentioned above, in the simple spherically symmetric case the
coefficients in Eq.  can be fitted using a simple steady-state model,
as derived by . However, for the more
complicated model that includes convection ), a more accurate calibration is needed, and the same holds for
applying the FEC+ to multi-dimensional simulations. For the present
paper, we therefore explicitly calculate the coefficients 𝑎and 𝑐in Eq.

et al. . As a consequence, there is as yet no a priori derivation
of the threshold value, i.e. the coefficient 𝑏. Instead, we empirically
determine the threshold 𝑏by analyzing hundreds of 1D+ simulations
in the next section. In practice, the threshold is found to be around
The presence of density discontinuities in the pre-SN progenitor can
play a significant role in the explosion . In particular, the den-
sity discontinuity located near the Si/O interface is responsible for
triggering the explosion in the vast majority of progenitors. However,
as we will quantitatively show in the remainder of this paper, the ac-
cretion of this interface onto the shock triggers the explosion only if
the star is already close to exploding . This requires multi-dimensional effects and
is therefore only possible in 2D, 3D, or 1D+ simulations. Specifi-
cally, Wang et al.  and Boccioli et al.  found that one
can build a criterion based on the density drop at the Si/O interface
that can successfully predict the explodability of > 90% progenitors.
In particular, both studies independently showed that when the den-
sity drop is such that 𝛿𝜌2
Si/O/𝜌2
Si/O > 0.08 
sion will ensue. However, for high compactness progenitors, which
are more common at low metallicities, Boccioli & Fragione 
showed that, even in the absence of this density drop, a successful
shock revival would still occur, hinting that the explosion mechanism
for these high-compactness stars is slightly different.
The Si/O interface usually occurs in correspondence with a pocket
of oxygen inside the silicon-sulfur shell, which is why it should more
precisely be referred to as a Si/O interface. For the sake of brevity,
we will however refer to it simply as a Si/O interface in the remainder
of this paper. Usually, the shock reaches this interface a few hundred
milliseconds  after bounce, i.e. during the
stalled shock phase. The sudden drop in density causes the ram
pressure of the infalling material to suddenly decrease, and the shock
is therefore able to expand to larger radii. Under favorable conditions,
this expansion turns into a runaway explosion, causing a successful
shock revival. This has been shown by several multi-dimensional
simulations in the past few years , where a successful shock
revival occurs right after the shock reaches the Si/O interface. Notice
that, especially for 2D simulations, there are instances where the Si/O
interface is accreted at times between 200−400 ms after bounce and
the explosion instead is triggered much later, at times between 700 ms
and 1 s . Moreover,
both in 2D and 3D simulations, different nuclear equations of state
can lead to earlier or later explosions, depending on the details of the
microphysics .
This suggests that, after the interface is accreted onto the shock, if
the change in ram pressure is large enough to disrupt the quasi-steady
state, then an explosion will occur. Otherwise, the perturbation might
be large enough to move the standing accretion shock to larger radii,
but not large enough to completely disrupt the quasi-steady state. In
that case, the shock will stall at larger radii and, eventually, it will
slowly recede and the explosion will fail . In the remainder of this paper, we will quan-
titatively test this hypothesis using the generalized force explosion
condition  described in Section 2.1.
To analyze how the accretion of the Si/O interface affects the ex-
plosion, we employed a series of simulations performed with the
open-source code GR1D ,
modified as described in Boccioli et al.  to include the effect
of neutrino driven convection via the Reynolds decomposition model
based on time-dependent mixing-length theory STIR . The equation of state for all simulations is the SFHo equa-
tion of state for nuclear matter , and neutrino opacities from Bruenn , with
weak-magnetism and recoil corrections from Horowitz , and
the virial correction for neutrino-nucleon scattering from Horowitz
et al. . Neutrino-electron scattering opacities follow the in-
elastic treatment of . The neutrino transport solves the
two-moment equations and uses the analytic M1 closure scheme to
relate the radiation pressure to the radiation energy density and mo-
mentum . The neutrino spectrum is resolved with
The spatial resolution was the same for all of the simulated pro-
genitors . We adopted a grid of 700 zones
linearly spaced up to 20 km, with a resolution of 300 m, and then
logarithmically spaced out to 15,000 km. The decision of using the
same spatial grid for all progenitors was motivated by the fact that
the extra heating from STIR has a weak dependence on the spatial
resolution, as shown in Boccioli et al. , particularly behind the
shock.
The STIR model  is based on a Reynolds decom-
position of the Euler equations, and it relies on a mixing-length-like
closure that relates higher-order turbulent correlations to lower-order
turbulent correlations. The STIR model is a local algebraic model
for which the equations are closed using algebraic relationships at a
local level. Other models explored different closures .
The main modification that STIR introduces is to the internal
energy equation, although extra diffusive terms must also be added
to the equations describing the evolution of the electron fraction
and the neutrino energy. STIR evolves the internal energy and the
turbulent energy separately, and therefore the evolution equation of
the total energy is the combination of those two ):

𝑒includes the contributions from both internal and kinetic energy.
Notice that GR1D solves the general relativistic version of the above
equation, but we show the Newtonian version for simplicity. The
quantities 𝜔BV and Λmix are the Brunt-Väisälä frequency and the

corrections, for simplicity. However, it should be highlighted that
one should use the total energy 𝜌 in the expression of the
Brunt-Väisälä frequency, as shown in Eq. , rather than simply 𝜌.
This can change the magnitude of the Brunt-Väisälä by more than
the main parameter of the model: 𝛼MLT. A larger value of 𝛼MLT
increases the magnitude of the mixing length, which as can be seen
from Eq.  corresponds to introducing a larger source of turbulent
energy, and therefore stronger convection and subsequent explosion.
The extra terms due to STIR are the last two terms on the RHS of
eq. 3, and the last two terms on the LHS. The terms on the LHS, i.e.
the diffusive terms, have a smaller  effect
on the overall dynamics compared to the terms on the RHS . If one applies the FEC+ to this model , then one finds that ˜𝑊𝑏in eq.  corresponds to the
last term on the RHS of eq. , whereas ⟨˜𝑅𝑟𝑟⟩corresponds to the
advection of 𝑃turb in eq. . Notice that the shear term ), is quite small, and therefore ignored in
the expression of the FEC+.
One of the primary aims of this manuscript is to use FEC+ to un-
derstand why the Si/O interface facilitates an explosion for most
ger explosions for other progenitors. The simulations for this study
are described in Boccioli & Fragione . In particular, Figure 1
shows the evolution of the shock radius and the FEC+ for 341 GR1D+
simulations of KEPLER progenitors from Sukhbold et al.  and
Woosley et al. , with masses ranging from 9 𝑀⊙to 120 M⊙
and metallicities of 𝑧= 0, 𝑧= 10−4𝑧⊙, and 𝑧= 𝑧⊙, where 𝑧⊙indi-
cates solar metallicity. The solid-green curves show simulations that
eventually explode, and the black curves shows simulations that fail
to explode. The most striking feature in the FEC+ plot 
is that there is a clear separation between failed and successful ex-
plosions for a value of FEC+ around 0.28–0.3. This is yet another
example showing that the FEC+ can be used as an explosion diag-
nostic. In this manuscript, we will use the FEC+ to diagnose why the
Si/O interface helps facilitate explosions sometimes but not always.
For the present analysis, we analyze the post-bounce phase of the
aforementioned 341 simulations. The role of the Si/O interface can
be divided into three categories: 1) the accretion of the Si/O interface
through the shock immediately triggers a vigorous explosion, 2) the
accretion of the interface triggers outward movement of the shock,
the shock stalls again, retreats a little, and then explodes, 3) the
accretion of the interface triggers outward progression of the shock,
which subsequently stalls again and does not explode.
Generally, what determines which category a specific progenitor
belongs to is how large the density drop at the Si/O interface is, and
how late the interface is accreted. We consider a "large" interface
one characterized by 𝛿𝜌2
Si/O/𝜌2
Si/O > 0.08, consistent with the ex-
plodability criterion derived independently by Boccioli et al. 
and Wang et al. , as summarized in Section 2.2. Moreover,
in some high compactness  cases, explosions occur regardless
of the accretion of the density drop. The compactness is defined as
𝜉M =
𝑀/𝑀⊙
𝑅/1000 km,
Therefore, one can identify 6 different scenarios, shown by select
simulations in Figure 2, that describe the post-bounce evolution of
both exploding and non-exploding models:

This constitutes ∼15% of all the analyzed simulations, including the
The remaining ∼3 −4% of the analyzed simulations are outliers.
For example, four progenitors with large compactness do not explode,
whereas 10 progenitors with large Si/O interfaces accreted towards
the beginning or the end of the stalled-shock phase do not explode.
It is worth noting here that while these outliers do not conform
to the Si/O interface condition for explosion, all simulations are
consistent with the FEC+ explosion condition, i.e. the FEC+ never
crosses the threshold. Perhaps the most interesting outlier is the
drop very late  but instead leads
to a successful explosion. We include this progenitor in Figure 2 to
highlight the unusual time evolution of the FEC+ and shock radius.
Two more progenitors, i.e. the 23.4 and 23.2 𝑀⊙with 𝑧= 10−4𝑧⊙
have a similar pre-SN structure and post-bounce evolution. However,
these progenitors have high compactness , and the Si/O
interface is accreted a bit earlier. Therefore their shock radius and
FEC+ time evolution are not quite as unusual as they are for the

progenitors for which the explosion has not been launched. There is a clear bifurcation in FEC+, and empirically it can be seen that progenitors who reach a
threshold around ∼0.28–0.3 explode. Those that do not reach this threshold do not explode.

Each progenitor is an example of a different explosive and non-explosive scenario, as discussed in the text . Moreover, we also show the 24.2 𝑀⊙
which does not fall in any of those scenarios, and it also has a very peculiar time evolution of the FEC+, which quickly dips similarly to what happens in failed
SNe, before suddenly increasing after the accretion of the Si/O interface, which however does not seem to affect the FEC+. In the left and middle panels, circles
and diamonds mark the times before and after the accretion of the Si/O interface, respectively. See Section 4.1 for a description of how these times are defined.

threshold when the explosion sets in, whereas it clearly is for the 24.2
𝑀⊙progenitor.
Since the FEC+ represents a clear threshold for explosion, and
we know exactly which components contribute to its evolution, it is
also a useful diagnostic to understand why the accretion of the Si/O
interface initiates explosion when it does. In the two leftmost panels
of Figure 2, we indicated the time before and after the accretion of
the Si/O interface  with circles
and diamonds. We define 𝑡start
accr as the time when the inner side of
the Si/O interface is accreted through the shock. A more detailed
description of how we define 𝑡end
accr is given later in Section 4.1. In
the following, we analyze the FEC+ evolution for each of the above
scenarios, showcased in Figure 2.
The 40 M⊙progenitor accretes the Si/O interface significantly
after the explosion has started. Therefore, the accretion of the Si/O
interface does not play a role whatsoever in the explosion of this
progenitor. This is confirmed by the smooth evolution of the FEC+,
without any rapid increase caused by the accretion of the Si/O inter-
face. What distinguishes this progenitor is its large pre-SN compact-
ness 𝜉2.0 = 0.75 that causes the neutrino heating to be very large,
which drives the FEC+ to go above the threshold and trigger the
explosion. A more thorough analysis of the role of compactness in
triggering the explosion is currently underway and beyond the scope
of this paper.
The 20 M⊙progenitor has a large density drop at the Si/O interface,
and therefore the shock revival is more pronounced than, for example,
MNRAS 000, 1–13 
L. Boccioli et al.
in the case of the 12.5 M⊙progenitor. This translates into a large
increase of the FEC+ that is pushed above the threshold, indicating
that an explosion occurs.
The 12.5 M⊙has a small density drop which is reflected in a small
increase in the FEC+. However, this increase is not large enough
to push the FEC+ above the threshold, and therefore the explosion
eventually fails.
The 18.2 M⊙has a large density drop, which is however accreted at
ended. As can be seen from the left panel of Figure 2 the shock radius
quickly recedes at very small radii after ∼250-300 ms. Therefore,
even though a large interface is accreted at late times, the shock
cannot be revived anymore. In multi-dimensional simulations, where
not only neutrino-driven convection but also other instabilities and
asymmetries can develop, the stalled-shock phase might be longer
and/or more asymmetric, which could change the outcome of the
simulation.
The 19.5 M⊙progenitor shows a unique behavior. A very large
density drop is accreted early in the evolution. However, since the
FEC+ is still small when the accretion occurs, it does not increase
enough to go above the threshold. Therefore, the explosion is not
triggered after the accretion of the interface, and in principle, one
would expect the explosion to fail. However, since this early accretion
causes the shock to stall at larger radii than any of the other progen-
itors, the FEC+ at around 150 −200 ms is the largest among the
progenitors shown. Therefore, between 200 and 300 ms, the FEC+
is barely below the threshold. Eventually, at around 600-700 ms, the
FEC+ finally goes above the threshold causing a  late ex-
plosion. One can speculate about what the cause of the explosion
is. For most progenitors, it is the accretion of the Si/O interface that
directly launches the explosion by reducing the ram pressure on the
shock. For this specific progenitor ,
the explosion happens much later than the accretion.
Nonetheless, the early accretion of the Si/O interface still plays a
crucial role in causing the explosion. This can be seen by comparing
the shock radius and FEC+ evolution for the 19.5 M⊙and the 15.5 M⊙
progenitors. These have almost identical pre-SN density  structures, as seen in the third panel of Figure 2, with
the important difference that the 15.5 M⊙progenitor has a smaller
density drop at the Si/O interface, and also a Si shell that is 0.125 M⊙
thicker, causing the interface to be accreted at a slightly later time.
The smaller density drop causes the shock radius and the FEC+ to
have a smaller increase, and therefore the FEC+ during the stalled-
shock phase  is smaller for the 15.5
M⊙progenitor. This is the reason why the 15.5 M⊙progenitor fails
whereas the 19.5 M⊙progenitor explodes at a much later time.
Another interesting feature of these two progenitors is that, since
they have a very similar post-bounce evolution, the shock trajectory
of the 15.5 M⊙progenitor would look pretty much exactly like the
one for the 19.5 M⊙progenitor if one were to use a larger value
of 𝛼MLT. This shows that most CCSNe are in general very close to
explosion, and small changes in the physics can lead to qualitatively
drastically different outcomes. In the next section, we will investigate
how changes in the strength of 𝜈-driven convection  and in the density drop at the Si/O interface can change the
shock and the evolution of the FEC+, leading to a successful or
failed explosion. It is important to remark that also changes in the
nuclear equation of state, neutrino opacities, asymmetries in the pre-
SN progenitor, beyond standard model physics, collective neutrino
oscillations, and more in general any physical input of the simulation,
can lead to similar differences in the outcome of the supernova.
Since numerical simulations are involved, not only changes to the
physics but also changes to the numerical setup and algorithms can
lead to different outcomes. For example, as mentioned in the previous
section, STIR has a weak dependence on resolution. Therefore, not
only changes to 𝛼MLT, but also changes to the numerical resolution
can lead to an explosion for the higher resolution simulation and
a failed supernova for the lower resolution simulation. This can be
generalized to the case of multi-dimensional simulations, where nu-
merical resolution is well-known to create different rates of turbulent
dissipation , which can
therefore affect the explodability.
To summarize, we qualitatively observed three types of explosions:
pansion and drives the FEC+ above the threshold, hence causing the
explosion;  the ones triggered indirectly by the accretion of the
Si/O interface , where the accretion of
this layer causes a significant shock expansion and pushes the FEC+
very close to the threshold until it eventually goes above and triggers
the explosion;  the ones triggered by a rapid increase of the FEC+,
which occurs in high-compactness progenitors such as the 40 M⊙in
Figure 2, not caused by accretions of any significant density drops,
but simply a very strong neutrino heating.
Most importantly, in all cases analyzed the explosion occurs after
the FEC+ goes above ∼0.28–0.3, despite the qualitative difference
in how the FEC+ crosses this threshold, which shows the robustness
and flexibility of the FEC+ as a diagnostic tool to determine the onset
of explosion .
CONVECTION AND ACCRETION OF THE SI/O
As shown in the previous section, the accretion of the Si/O inter-
face can often lead to the explosion of a CCSN. In this section, we
use the FEC+ to quantify in detail how the post-accretion expansion
of the shock depends on both the strength of 𝜈-driven convection
and the density drop at the Si/O interface. In addition to being a
condition for explosion, the FEC+ also quantifies a distance from
explosion. Therefore, it is useful as a quantitative measure of how
various physics affect the explosion outcome. It should be highlighted
that, in a more realistic 3D simulation, other multi-dimensional ef-
fects are also at play, and therefore the post-bounce phase is more
complicated. However, the simplicity of 1D+ simulations enables
systematic study of the interplay between the accretion of the Si/O
interface and parametrized 𝜈-driven convection.
To analyze the interplay between  neutrino-driven
convection and the accretion of the Si/O interface, one can analyze
how the FEC+ changes as a function of 𝛼MLT. Therefore, we simu-
lated the collapse and subsequent explosion of a 20 𝑀⊙from Farmer
et al.  for different values of 𝛼MLT. This progenitor is partic-
ularly interesting as it is characterized by a large density drop at the
Si/O interface. The shock evolution and the FEC+ as a function of
time after bounce are shown in Figure 3. As in Figure 1, one can see
that there is a threshold for the FEC+ around 0.28–0.3 that separates
explosions from failed SNe. As expected, simulations with small val-
ues of 𝛼MLT are further away from the threshold, and fail to explode.

𝛼MLT. To avoid cluttering, we only show exploding simulations with 𝛼MLT
spaced by 0.01, but a finer grid is shown in Figures 4 and 5.
Simulations with large values of 𝛼MLT cross the critical threshold
and lead to a successful explosion.
For the accretion of the Si/O interface to be sufficient to launch the
explosion, the FEC+ has to be already close to the threshold. This
is shown in the top panel of Figure 4, where the x-axis is the value
of the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr  and the y-axis
is the value of the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡end
accr .
Simulations with a value of FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr below ∼0.24 do not
explode, because once they accrete the interface the change in FEC+
is not enough to push it above threshold.
As can be seen in the bottom panel of Figure 3, the FEC+ peaks
right after the accretion of the Si/O interface, before settling down
to a more stable value. The reason behind this is that, as seen in
the top panel, the accretion of the Si/O interface causes a sudden,
extremely rapid expansion of the shock. In this transient phase, steady
state is briefly disrupted and since the FEC+ is derived assuming a
stalled shock solution, it cannot properly describe such rapid shock
expansion, hence explaining the sudden peak in the FEC+.
To avoid the unexplained peak of the FEC+, we define the 𝑡end
accr to
be the time for which the transient phase has passed 1, corresponding
to the diamonds in Figures 3.
All of the exploding simulations in Figure 3 are characterized by
a value of the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡end
accr above 0.28–0.3.
The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows that the values of the FEC+
at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr and 𝑡= 𝑡end
accr are related to the shock radii before and after
the accretion, as one would expect. Moreover, both panels show a
linear correlation between FEC+ and shock radius before and after
accretion, and both quantities also positively correlate with 𝛼MLT.
The correlations for the FEC+ show a bit more scatter, although
given the noise present in the FEC+ as a function of time  it is not surprising.
A similar correlation can be seen between ΔFEC+ 
and the value of FEC+  at 𝑡start
accr , as
shown in Figure 5. The quantities ΔFEC+ and Δ𝑅shock are defined
as the differences between the values of FEC+ and shock radius
after and before the accretion of the Si/O interface. Larger 𝛼MLT, i.e.
stronger 𝜈-driven convection, leads to the shock stalling at a larger
radius, causing the FEC+ to be larger, and eventually the accretion
of the Si/O interface causes a proportionally larger increase in FEC+
and shock radius.
Quantitatively, we observe that during the accretion, the Si/O in-
terface increases the FEC+ by about 0.03–0.04  for 𝛼MLT around the best-value of 1.51. This increase is about 10%
of the FEC+ threshold, and it is about one-third of the overall effect
of convection, which aids the explosion condition by about 25–30%
To summarize, for a given density profile with a given Si/O in-
terface, increasing 𝛼MLT will cause the shock to stall at larger radii,
increasing the overall FEC+. When the Si/O interface is accreted,
the shock expansion and the increase in FEC+ will also be larger. In
particular, this increase is directly proportional to both 𝛼MLT and the
radius of the shock  at 𝑡start
accr.
For a successful explosion to ensue, the FEC+ must be already
close enough to the threshold  when
the Si/O interface is accreted.
Another conclusion that can be drawn from the present analysis
is that accurately simulating the effects of the convection is crucial
since it contributes to determining the time evolution of the shock.
This can significantly change the outcomes of the explosion because,
as we have shown, the shock position before the accretion of the Si/O
interface is strictly related to the effect of the Si/O interface accretion
on the explosion condition.
In some 2D simulations, it has been shown that neutrino-driven
convection is not properly captured, due to the inverse turbulent
cascade caused by the imposed axisymmetry .
However, other studies have instead shown through detailed analysis
of neutrino-driven convection that the turbulent dissipation in 2D
simulations is compatible with the one found in 3D , and therefore the outcomes of the sim-
ulations should be the same. Moreover, 3D simulations can suffer
from finite-resolution effects, and low resolution might artificially
favor the explosion .

convection effects are necessary to improve future multi-dimensional
simulations.
Another way to observe the interplay between 
neutrino-driven convection and the accretion of the Si/O interface
is to study how the explosion and the FEC+ change when only the
Si/O interface changes, with everything else being the same. There-
fore, we artificially smoothed the density drop at the Si/O interface of
two different progenitors. The first two panels of Figures 6 and 7 show
the smoothing of a 20𝑀⊙MESA progenitor  and
a 21𝑀⊙KEPLER progenitor , respectively.
The "degree of smoothing" shown in the colorbar of those figures is
represented by the quantity Δ𝑅/Δ𝑅orig, where Δ𝑅is the radial extent
of the Si/O interface, and Δ𝑅orig refers to the original progenitor
without any smoothing. Therefore, a more pronounced smoothing
corresponds to a larger Δ𝑅where the density profile falls off less
steeply.
After smoothing the density profile, we calculated the new pressure
by imposing hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas we did not change the
electron fraction 𝑌e, which only changes by ≲1% anyway. Finally,
FEC+
Figure 5. The top panel shows on the y-axis the increase in FEC+ due to
the accretion of the Si/O interface. This quantity, i.e. ΔFEC+, is simply the
difference between the value of the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡end
accr and at 𝑡start
accr . The x-axis
is the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr , the same as for Figure 4. The times before and after
accretion are shown as circles and diamonds in Figure 3. For a description of
how exactly the times before and after accretion are defined, see the text. Only
simulations with 𝛼MLT ≥1.48 are shown, since in other cases the FEC+ and
shock radius do not show any significant "jumps". The increase in FEC+ is
proportional to 𝛼MLT and to the value of the FEC+ at 𝑡start
accr , and for exploding
progenitors with 𝛼MLT around 1.51 it is between 0.03 and 0.04, which is
roughly 10% of the FEC+ threshold. The bottom panel is the same as the top
one but for shock radius instead of FEC+.
with the new density, pressure, and electron fraction, we calculated
the rest of the thermodynamic quantities by inverting the equation of
state. We did not change the collapse velocities. Notice that, with this
procedure, we are effectively adding mass outside the Si/O interface,
since the density of the smoothed profiles is larger. However, this
corresponds to a maximum of 0.02 𝑀⊙and 0.025 𝑀⊙for the 20𝑀⊙
MESA progenitor and the 21𝑀⊙KEPLER progenitor, respectively.
The artificially added mass is therefore small enough that it will not
perturb the evolution in any way other than the change in the density
jump at the Si/O interface.
One caveat that should be mentioned is that in principle this is not
self-consistent since the Si/O interface corresponds to a change in
composition. Therefore, one should actively change the composition
at the Si/O interface to obtain a fully consistent thermodynamic
profile, which would require a self-consistent simulation. However,
this is quite challenging and would potentially modify the entire
thermodynamic profile, and not only the Si/O interface. Therefore,
we adopted this simpler approach of directly modifying the density
profile, which is the most important quantity responsible for changing

to the procedure outlined in the text. Larger values of Δ𝑅/Δ𝑅orig correspond to a higher degree of smoothing. The first panel shows the pre-collapse density

the ram pressure and, consequently, the effect of the accretion of the
Si/O interface through the shock.
The results of the simulations for the 20 𝑀⊙MESA progenitor
from Farmer et al.  and for the 21 𝑀⊙KEPLER progenitor
from Sukhbold et al.  are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respec-
tively. These two progenitors were chosen because of their large
interfaces and the number of computational zones within the inter-
face, allowing for a more accurate smoothing procedure. Moreover,
the accretion of the Si/O interface occurs at ∼0.22 s after bounce
for the 20 𝑀⊙MESA progenitor, and at 0.1 s post bounce for the
accretion changes the impact of the interface on the explosion.
The second panel of Figures 6 & 7 shows the average mass ac-
cretion rate in the gain region and, as expected, a smoother density
profile at the Si/O interface corresponds to a shallower drop in mass
accretion rate, which therefore prevents the shock from expanding.
The third panels of those figures show the shock evolution for progen-
itors with different degrees of smoothing. The original progenitors
explode and as the smoothing increases the shock expansion caused
by the accretion of the Si/O interface becomes smaller, until even-
tually, it is not large enough to trigger explosion. This can be seen
by looking at the last panel, which shows that for the unmodified
progenitor, the FEC+ goes above the threshold as a consequence of
the accretion of the Si/O interface, resulting in an explosion. As the
smoothing increases, the increase is smaller and smaller until the
FEC+ is not pushed above the threshold, and therefore the star does
not explode.
The 20 𝑀⊙MESA progenitor and the 21 𝑀⊙KEPLER progeni-
tor show the same general behavior concerning smoothing, and the
threshold of the FEC+ is at around 0.28–0.3, consistent with the one
found in the simulations discussed in sections 3 and 4.1. Moreover,
the 21 𝑀⊙KEPLER progenitor shows an early accretion of the Si/O
interface, much like the 19.5 𝑀⊙progenitor shown in Figure 2, the
difference being that the Si/O interface for the 21 𝑀⊙progenitor has
a larger 𝛿𝜌/𝜌, and therefore explodes early. However, as the degree
of smoothing increases, one can see that for Δ𝑅/Δ𝑅orig ≈10  the 21 𝑀⊙progenitor has a very similar
behavior to the 19.5 𝑀⊙progenitor. An early accretion of a relatively
large Si/O interface leads to the shock stalling at a large radius, and
the FEC+ being pushed just below threshold. Eventually, the FEC+
slowly increases and the star explodes a few hundred milliseconds
later. If one increases the smoothing further, the star does not explode.
This confirms that the explosion scenario  in Section 3, i.e.
where the explosion is indirectly triggered by an early accretion of a
large Si/O interface followed by a late explosion, is indeed an "edge
case". The accretion of the Si/O interface needs to be quite early, and
the density drop should not be too small, like in the case of the 15.5
𝑀⊙progenitor in Figure 2. It should also not be too large, like in the
case of the 21 𝑀⊙progenitor studied here, which eventually behaves
like the 19.5 𝑀⊙progenitor in Figure 2 only when the density drop
is artificially smoothed.
This study shows how important it is to properly calculate the
Si/O interface. This is no easy feat, given the complexity of stellar
evolution calculations. For one these shells may or may not be a
consequence of how 1D stellar evolution models handle the bound-
aries between stable layers and convectively unstable layers, which
are inherently 3D, and even in simple 1D calculations, shell mergers
might occur depending on how the convective boundaries evolve.
In addition, it is well known that reduced burning networks, which
decrease the computational cost and facilitate convergence, can be
quite unreliable at the late stages of post-main sequence evolution of
massive stars .
FEC+
In Section 4.1 we showed how the change of the FEC+ induced by
the accretion of the Si/O interface is proportional to the strength of
neutrino-driven convection, and also to the value of the FEC+ itself
right before the accretion. In this section, we quantify how the Si/O
interface impacts the explosion by calculating the changes in the
FEC+ caused by the accretion of the Si/O interface across the 341
progenitors analyzed in section 3.
First, one has to distinguish among the three major outcomes,
displayed in Figure 8 with three different color schemes: 1) failed
explosions shown as black dots; 2) high-compactness progenitors
that usually explode before the accretion of the Si/O interface, shown
as purple dots; 3) explosions caused by the accretion of the Si/O
interface, shown as colored dots and crosses.
First, we focus our analysis on how the value of the FEC+ at
𝑡= 𝑡start
accr is related to the value of the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡end
accr . We define the time before  accretion as the time
when the inner  side of the Si/O interface, i.e. the left 
edge of the rectangles in the right panel of Figure 2 is accreted
through the shock. This definition accurately captures the change

Figure 7. Same as Figure 6, but for a 21 𝑀⊙KEPLER progenitor 
in FEC+ for failed explosions  and high-compactness
progenitors . However, one needs to be more careful
when the explosion occurs after the accretion of the Si/O interface
after accretion" as the time after which the transient phase has ended,
as explained in Section 4.1.
For the failed explosions  one expects scatter around
the bisector. The reason is that when the Si/O interface is small  it will not modify much the FEC+, and
therefore the FEC+ before and after the Si/O interface is accreted
through the shock should not be very different. The only exception
is when the accretion happens during a rapid shock expansion , typically at early  times after bounce. By the time the
outer edge of the Si/O interface is accreted, the FEC+ has there-
fore changed significantly. This explains the points above and below
the bisector, for which the accretion occurs at early and late times,
respectively.
For the high-compactness progenitors, shown as purple dots, one
expects the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr to be already above the threshold
since, in most cases, the explosion sets in before the accretion of the
Si/O interface. This is indeed confirmed by the fact that most of the
purple dots are located at values of FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr larger than 0.3,
indicating that the explosion has already set in. Note that there are
three isolated cases in which accretion of the Si/O interface happens
very early in the evolution while the shock is still expanding and has
not yet reached the stalled shock phase. In these cases, while the early
accretion of the Si/O interface changes the FEC+, the main change
is due to the expansion of the shock.
Finally, the exploding progenitors with 𝜉2.0 < 0.5 are the re-
maining dots and crosses, color-coded based on the time when the
accretion of the Si/O interface occurs. For these, the Si/O interface
triggers an explosion, and the FEC+ quantifies why. Before the ac-
cretion of the Si/O interface, FEC+ is below the threshold, and after
the accretion of the Si/O interface FEC+ is at or above the threshold.
The progenitors shown as crosses are characterized by a very early
accretion of the Si/O interface  and are therefore exceptions that will be
discussed later in the section.
Similar conclusions can be drawn from the middle panel, in which
ΔFEC+  is plotted against the value of the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr. The
correlation between these two qunatities is quite evident. The rea-
son is that, if the accretion occurs early in the post-bounce phase,
the shock is still expanding, and therefore the FEC+ is also increas-
ing. Therefore, one expects larger ΔFEC+ since not only does the
accretion increases the FEC+, but the secular shock expansion also
contributes to the increase. This is confirmed by the fact that sim-
ulations with early accretions  also exhibit larger
ΔFEC+. As mentioned above, the reason is that if the accretion of the
Si/O interface occurs early enough in the post-bounce phase, then the
FEC+ increases not only because of the accretion but also because of
the secular shock expansion. Notice that this discussion is not valid
for failed explosions and high-compactness progenitors.
In the last panel, we show ΔFEC+ as a function of 𝛿𝜌2
Si/O/𝜌2
Si/O,
where 𝜌2
Si/O is the density on the inner side of the Si/O interface,
and 𝛿𝜌Si/O is the density drop from the inner to the outer side of
the interface. Examples of this are given in the rightmost panel of
Figure 2. One would naively expect larger density drops to cause
larger ΔFEC+, and indeed that trend is generally visible. However, it
is also polluted by a large vertical scatter, which is due to early time
accretions, for which not only the accretion of the Si/O interface, but
also secular shock expansion contribute to ΔFEC+. This is confirmed
by the fact that, given the same 𝛿𝜌2
Si/O/𝜌2
Si/O, simulations where
the Si/O interface is accreted at early times lead to larger ΔFEC+.
Therefore, if one takes into account the contribution to the FEC+
by secular shock expansion, one can find a much tighter dependence
of ΔFEC+ on 𝛿𝜌2
Si/O/𝜌2
Si/O. By only selecting progenitors that have
a relatively similar accretion time of the Si/O interface  defined in Section 3, for which the
early accretion of the Si/O interface does not push the FEC+ above
the threshold, but instead pushes it very close to it, facilitating the oc-
currence of an explosion a few hundred milliseconds later. Therefore
one expects the FEC+at 𝑡= 𝑡end
accr to be below the threshold, and the
ΔFEC+ to be very large since the earlier the accretion, the faster the
shock expansion, and therefore the larger the FEC+ increase. This
is indeed confirmed by the left and middle panels in Figure 8. Most
of the simulations shown as rainbow-colored dots instead belong to
scenario 2) defined in Section 3. These are cases where the accretion
of a large Si/O interface occurs during the stalled shock phase, pushes
the FEC+ above the threshold, and therefore causes the explosion.
As seen in the left panel of Figure 8, for some of them the FEC+ at
𝑡= 𝑡end
accr is however below the threshold, and 𝑡accr > 0.1 s. These can
be thought of as intermediate cases between scenarios 2) and 3). The
accretion of the Si/O interface occurs at the very beginning of the
stalled shock phase.

explosion condition
In Section 4.1 we already compared the magnitude of ΔFEC+ with
the overall explosion threshold of 0.28–0.3. However, that was done
only for one progenitor, and we found that ΔFEC+ is about 10% of the
explosion condition. With the much larger sample of 341 progenitors,
we can perform the same exercise and estimate the average impact
that the Si/O interface has on the explosion condition. This is not
a straightforward task since, as explained above, the secular shock
expansion can sometimes overlap with the increase in FEC+ due
to the Si/O interface accretion. Therefore, we exclude all of the
high-compactness progenitors from the subsequent analysis, since as
explained above the vast majority accreted the Si/O interface after
the explosion has started. Then, we limit our sample to exploding
progenitors that accrete the Si/O interface during the stalled-shock
phase, when changes to the FEC+ can be attributed exclusively to the
accretion of the interface, rather than to secular shock expansion. This
can be achieved by excluding all progenitors for which the accretion
of the interface occurs before a certain time or, alternatively, by
excluding all progenitors for which the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr is below
a certain value. Depending on the chosen condition, the sample will
be different.
In Table 1 we show how different cuts on 𝑡accr and the value of the
FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr affect the sample size. Then, for the progenitors
that satisfy those conditions, we calculate the median, mean, and se-
lected quantiles of ΔFEC+. We find the conditions 𝑡accr > 0.18 s and
FEC+ > 0.24 to lead to almost the same sample. We also consider
them to be the best cuts since they include as many simulations as
possible, without however including cases where significant secular
shock expansion is occurring alongside the accretion of the Si/O in-
terface. Notice that the condition that the FEC+ at 𝑡= 𝑡start
accr should
be > 0.24 is the same found in Section 4.1 in order for the 20𝑀⊙
MESA progenitor to explode. For both samples, the median ΔFEC+
is ∼0.035, which is in line with what was found for the 20𝑀⊙
MESA progenitor, and it is ∼10% of the explosion condition, to be
compared with the 25–30% effect of convection . The first and third quartiles are ∼0.023 and ∼0.046, which
correspond to ∼8% and ∼15% of the explosion condition, and more
than 90% of the simulations have ΔFEC+ > 0.015, corresponding
MNRAS 000, 1–13 
L. Boccioli et al.
to ∼5% of the explosion condition. This shows that the accretion
of the Si/O interface has a crucial impact on the explosion of pro-
genitors with compactness 𝜉2.0 < 0.5. This impact can be quantified
to be between 5% and 15% of the overall explosion condition, or
equivalently between 20% and 50% of the effect of convection.
In this paper, we analyzed the post-bounce phase of 341 1D+ simula-
tions using the generalized Force Explosion Condition . We
found that when the FEC+ goes beyond the threshold, empirically
found to be around 0.28–0.3, an explosion ensues. We identified three
scenarios where an explosion is achieved:  High-compactness pro-
genitors tend to always explode, often before accreting the Si/O in-
terface;  lower-compactness progenitors, with 𝜉2.0 ≲0.5, achieve
an explosion if a large enough density drop 
is accreted through the shock during the stalled-shock phase;  a
progenitor with 𝜉2.0 ≲0.5 achieves an explosion significantly after
the accretion of a large density drop before the stalled-shock phase.
For failed explosions, we identified three scenarios: 4) a progenitor
with 𝜉2.0 ≲0.5 accretes a large density drop before the stalled-
shock phase, although smaller than in scenario 3), and therefore
not sufficient to cause an explosion; 5) a progenitor with 𝜉2.0 ≲
stalled-shock phase; 6) a progenitor with 𝜉2.0 ≲0.5 accretes either a
small or large density drop late in the stalled-shock phase when the
shock cannot be revived anymore.
In all cases, the explosions ensue only when the FEC+ crosses
the threshold of 0.28–0.3, showing that the FEC+ is a robust tool to
describe the explosion condition.
We also studied how the FEC+  varies
depending on the strength of 𝜈-driven convection . We again showed that the explosion occurs
only when the FEC+ goes above the threshold of 0.28–0.3 empirically
derived in Section 3, which confirms the robustness of the FEC+ as
an explosion condition. We showed that the value of the FEC+ at
𝑡= 𝑡start
accr, as well as the change in FEC+ caused by the accretion
of the Si/O interface, are positively correlated. They also positively
correlate with 𝛼MLT, the radius of the stalled shock and the increase in
shock radius caused by the accretion of the interface. This confirms
the key role that convection has in aiding the explosion, which is
extremely important since it has been shown that, for example, three-
dimensional asymmetries in the pre-SN progenitor 
can significantly change the strength of convection that develops
in the post-bounce phase. Moreover, it is still unclear if and how
numerical resolution 
or the dimensionality of the problem  can artificially alter the efficiency of convection.
Moreover, we show that the change in the FEC+ due to the accre-
tion of the Si/O interface becomes progressively smaller by artifi-
cially smoothing the density drop at the Si/O interface. Eventually,
for a large enough smoothing parameter, the FEC+ drops below the
threshold causing the originally successful explosion to fail. Once
again, we verified that the threshold in these simulations is also at
around 0.28–0.3. We conclude that for progenitors with low to inter-
mediate compactness , the presence of a large density
drop at the Si/O interface is crucial to determine whether or not an
explosion occurs.
Finally, we analyzed how the change in FEC+ is related to the value
of the FEC+ right before accretion of the Si/O interface through the
shock, and also to the density drop at the Si/O interface 𝛿𝜌2
Si/O/𝜌2
Si/O.
We concluded that for the accretion of the Si/O interface to lead
to successful explosions, the FEC+ should already be close to the
explosion threshold, depending on how large the density drop at the
Si/O interface is. We then quantified the effect of the Si/O interface
accretion by analyzing the exploding progenitors with 𝜉2.0 ≲0.5.
The analysis for progenitors accreting the interface early  is complicated by the fact that the FEC+
changes not only because of the shock expansion caused by the ac-
cretion of the Si/O interface, but also because of a secular shock
expansion. By focusing only on progenitors where the secular shock
expansion is negligible, we find that the accretion of the Si/O inter-
face can contribute between 5 % and 15% to the overall explosion
condition, i.e. between 20% and 50% of the overall effect of convec-
tion, which has been estimated to decrease the explosion condition
by about 25–30 % .
The FEC+ is a powerful tool to analyze the post-bounce phase
of the CCSN, and can be also applied to multi-dimensional simu-
lations, where however more complex phenomena and geometries
are at play, and therefore more careful analysis is required. These
convection and the accretion of the Si/O interface can be crucial for
the explosion, and therefore future CCSN simulations should ensure
that convection is properly resolved and carefully analyzed.
Moreover, it is important to utilize  pre-
collapse models whose late stages of evolution have been carefully
calculated. Since the density drop at the Si/O interface plays such
a crucial role in the explosion, contributing to roughly 10 % of the
overall explosion condition, detailed stellar evolution models are re-
quired in order to accurately simulate the last few months of the life
of massive stars, where shell Si-burning becomes important and can
drastically modify the density discontinuity at the interface with the
oxygen shell.
