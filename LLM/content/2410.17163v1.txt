Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived radioisotopes , such
as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and desiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the
early Solar System. However, it remains unclear whether the early Solar System was highly enriched
relative to other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the Solar System
possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the interstellar medium, determining SLR
enrichment of individual protoplanetary disks observationally has not been performed and is markedly
more difficult. We use N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions
through two likely important SLR sources, stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae. We vary
the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming regions and implement two models of stellar wind
SLR propagation for the radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the Solar System
is at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more supernovae dependent isotope 60Fe
we find that the Solar System is comparatively very highly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our
previous research, these results suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on exoplanet
bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of the low-mass exoplanet census,
and that 60Fe is even less influential as a source of heating than previously assumed.

evolution of planets, in particular through their influence on planetesimal and protoplanet evolution . As these isotopes have a half-life commensurate with planetary formation timescales
planets around 1 Myr old stars,
Alves et al. 2020; Segura-Cox et al. 2020), they are present throughout the early planetesimal formation process,
concentrating onto planetesimals and debris as the disk agglomerates into a protoplanetary system .
SLRs are important for planetary formation as they provide a significant source of heating through radioactive decay
for nascent protoplanets and planetesimals.
This can increase the rate of chemical segregation within a forming
protoplanet , and is instrumental in the evaporation and removal of volatiles from planetesimals
through outgassing . Volatile outgassing is of particular
interest, as removal of H2O and other atmospheric volatiles from planetesimals prior to protoplanetary formation can

significantly impact the formation of extrasolar ocean worlds, and instead lead to relatively volatile-poor rocky worlds
instead .
It has been found that the Solar System has a significantly higher fraction of both 26Al and 60Fe than the interstellar
medium  , with an isotopic ratio 26Al/27Al  of ≈5×10−5 based on observations of decay
products in chondritic meteorites . The measurement of 60Fe is much more
controversial, though recent estimates  suggest an isotopic ratio 60Fe/56Fe  of ≈1×10−6,
which is also significantly higher than estimates of the abundance of this isotope in the ISM.
Some researchers have suggested that the parent giant molecular cloud  of the Solar System had a higher level
of SLR enrichment compared to the ISM, due to sequential star formation , whereas other
authors have proposed either internal production or delivery from an external source. Although 26Al can be produced
internally through cosmic ray spallation, this is insufficient and does not reflect the isotropic spatial distribution we
observe in the SLR distribution in the Solar System nor the fractionation between spallation and nucleosynthetic
processes . 60Fe cannot be produced via cosmic ray spallation .
Instead, one of the main proposed external delivery methods is through stellar winds, in which significant quantities
of 26Al are produced in the cores of massive stars , the convective core
circulates 26Al to the surrounding envelope, and is expelled as a part of the stellar wind. Whilst some 60Fe can be
emitted through massive stellar winds, this quantity is many orders of magnitude lower than the total wind mass of
through supernovae; however massive stars take upwards of 10 Myr to explode , by which
time disks are likely already far into producing protoplanets, preventing efficient isotope transfer from the outflow
to the planetary system before planetesimal formation . Finally, there
is additional evidence to suggest that a third category of enrichment is potentially important, which is the case of
the winds of “interloping” asymptotic giant branch  stars depositing SLRs into a recently formed star-forming
region . AGB stars wandering into star-forming regions have been
observed , however there has been limited study on the impact of such interlopers, or the
probability of this occurring with a star-forming region.
In this paper, we report the results of a series of N-body simulations of star-forming regions using AMUSE  where massive stellar winds and supernovae inject 26Al and 60Fe into protoplanetary disks surrounding
low-mass stars. The region size, population and density are varied significantly for each sub-set of simulations to
explore the star-forming region parameter space. This model utilises wind and supernova mass loss rates of SLRs from
work by Limongi & Chieffi , as well as statistical models of star-forming regions and stellar populations. Our
model aims to be more comprehensive than previous attempts to simulate SLR injection within star-forming regions
though there are a number of additional features and avenues of research that we will discuss in brief at the end of
the paper. The following section details the methodology of our work, in particular the programming framework and
implementation of various simulation features, Section 3 details our results, and Section 5 concludes and discusses
further research into this particular topic.
The simulation code used throughout this paper is written in Python, using the AMUSE framework to incorporate
pre-existing stellar evolution and N-body dynamics code. At the beginning of every time step, the code calculates
positions and velocities for each star in the simulated region, as well as the individual star properties such as mass loss
rates. The stellar properties are calculated using the SeBa stellar evolution code , while the dynamical properties are calculated using the BHTree N-body code . These properties are then utilised by the Python sections of the code authored for this paper, which calculate
enrichment through massive stellar winds and supernovae. In addition to this section, code to determine initial mass
functions and disk lifetimes was devised, and will be discussed in brief as well.
The AMUSE framework was used in the simulations in this paper to initialise, translate and manage the external
N-body and stellar evolution codes . While the N-body and stellar evolution codes in AMUSE can be bridged and run alongside
each other, the code written to calculate SLR enrichment cannot be run synchronously. As such, the main execution
loop is divided into a series of timesteps so that the enrichment routines can run in lockstep with the rest of AMUSE.
As closer encounters between stars are fleeting when compared to the simulation timescale, a relatively small timestep
is adopted in order to sample wind injection more accurately. We found that a total number of 1000 timesteps for
the enrichment code over 20 Myr was suitable for our simulations, the N-body and stellar evolution codes operate on
smaller timesteps.
The SeBa stellar evolution code was utilised to calculate mass loss rates for main and post-main sequence evolution
of stars within a star-forming region. SeBa is extremely fast, using an interpolated lookup table for stellar evolution
rather than directly calculating the stars’ properties – such as in the case of a Henyey code like MESA . Whilst this approximation method is less accurate, SeBa is
suitable for this work due to its speed. It is important to note that mass-loss rates due to winds can vary significantly
between stellar evolution models. However, a common factor between all models is that the bulk of mass loss over the
lifespan of a particularly massive star occurs after the main sequence, which is itself a comparatively short period of
time ; as such most enrichment will occur over this time, and should not vary significantly between
models. SeBa is also used to determine whether massive stars have undergone supernovae. Dynamic evolution of the
star-forming region is performed using the BHTree N-body code. BHTree is a 2nd-order accurate Barnes-Hut octree
code designed for large numbers of particles. Whilst pure N-body codes are more accurate, the extremely favourable
scaling characteristics  vs. O of pure solvers) allow hundreds of large scale simulations to be run
within an acceptable length of time on a 10-core Xeon workstation . As such, the reduction in
accuracy was deemed an acceptable trade-off for this project. Performance was further improved by using OpenMPI
to multi-thread BHTree . At every timestep the change in mass calculated through SeBa was
synchronised with BHTree to account for mass loss affecting gravitational attraction.
After the N-body solver and stellar evolution simulations are evolved to the next timestep, the code written for this
paper to calculate SLR enrichment is executed, as detailed in Section 2.3.
Upon programme initialisation a star-forming region with a given number of stars  and radius  is generated
via a Goodwin & Whitworth  box fractal method. The box fractal model spawns fractals by placing a “root”
particle in the centre of a cube of side Ndiv, which spawns N 3 “leaf” cubes, which can also contain their own “leaf”
particles. The probability of each generation producing offspring is equivalent to N D−3
div , fewer generations are produced
with a lower fractal dimension parameter, D, which is included as an input parameter to the algorithm . Lower values of D lead to more substructure and a less uniform appearance, while higher values
lead to a more homogeneous and spherical appearance. For our simulations we adopt a fractal dimension of D = 2.0,
as this gives a moderate amount of substructure, which is observed in many star-forming regions  and in simulations . Subsequent dynamical evolution makes it difficult to ascertain the initial degree of substructure in a typical
star-forming region , but D = 2.0 probably lies towards the
middle of the distribution of expected values. The initial velocities of the parent particles are drawn from a Gaussian
distribution, with a small random component that scales as N D−3
but reduces for each progressive generation. After
generating the positions and velocities of the stars within the star-forming region, the masses are calculated from an
implementation of the Maschberger initial mass function . The Maschberger IMF is described
in the form of a probability density function following the formula:
P ∝M⋆
µ is the scale parameter. As per Maschberger’s prescription, we use values of α = 2.3, β = 1.4 and µ = 0.2. The mass
range of the Maschberger prescription is between 0.01 M⊙and 150 M⊙. When generating a population of stars, we
ensure that there is at least one high-mass star  in the resultant region and the IMF routine is repeatedly
run until this condition is met . Stochastic sampling of the IMF can result in low-mass
stellar populations that  contain massive stars . Nicholson & Parker 
demonstrate that – assuming a standard Cluster Mass Function of the form Nclus ∝M −2
clus – these unusual low-mass
populations that contain high mass stars occur as often as high-mass clusters which are almost certain to contain
massive stars. So whilst we do not simulate those clusters that do not contain massive stars , our enrichment distributions should be interpreted for stellar populations where some enrichment can
occur.
All stars in the simulation have the same formation time; whilst there would be some margin of age difference
in the stars this would introduce an additional parameter to explore, significantly increasing the required number
of simulations. Furthermore, SeBa and by extension AMUSE cannot be used to simulate mixed-age stellar populations
within a single cluster datatype. Finally, binarity of massive stars is not modelled, as wind-wind interactions of massive
stars and how this affects dust formation and growth is not well established – though in ideal cases there would be a
significant increase in 26Al wind abundance . We will study the effects of massive star binarity
on the enrichment of low-mass stars in a future paper.
Each low-mass star  is assumed to form a protoplanetary
disk with a radius of 100 AU, to facilitate a direct comparison with our previous work  – though we note that other prescriptions for setting the disk radius as a function of stellar mass are used in
the literature . Our disks have a fixed mass dependent on the stellar mass following
the formula:
Mdisk = 0.1 M⋆,
SLR’s stable isotope counterparts. We assume a stable aluminium mass fraction of:
M27Al = 0.0085 Mdust,
M56Fe = 0.1828 Mdust,
to occur post-star-formation. Disk truncation through stellar winds and ionising radiation flux are not simulated, but
could be included in successive versions of this model. The lifetime of each protoplanetary disk is pre-calculated and
derived from an exponential probability density function of the form:
p  = 1
β e−x/β,
the mean disk lifetime, consistent with the findings in Richert et al. . An example of the disk population over
time can be seen in Fig. 1. Stars with masses above 3 M⊙are not assigned disks, as they are markedly less likely to
form planetary systems containing rocky bodies . Final enrichment is calculated
at the point where the individual disk has “progressed” from a disk to a protoplanetary system. Beyond this point,
the system is no longer capable of further SLR pollution, and the final enrichment value is stored. A more advanced
model could reduce the efficiency of the disk in absorbing SLRs as planetesimals begin to form, before culminating in
a finished protoplanetary system, though for our work this 2-phase method should suffice.
For this paper we only simulate the effect of wind and SNe-based enrichment of the proto-planetary disk. SLR
enrichment from other mechanisms such as sequential star formation, spallation or molecular cloud pre-enrichment are
not considered. Estimates for wind and supernovae yields of SLRs from massive stars were derived from simulations
performed in Limongi & Chieffi . For this paper we use their recommended  model with a star rotational
velocity of 300 km s−1. There is a small difference in 26Al yield in the 150 km s−1 model and the 300 km s−1 model
between 13 M⊙to 20 M⊙, though for the 20 M⊙case there is a higher yield in the 150 km s−1 model. The 0 km s−1
model was not considered as this was unrealistic

the end of their lives. Due to the relatively short disk lifetime most of the stellar disks have progressed to the planetesimal

is under debate, de Mink et al. 2013), and significantly suppressed 26Al yields compared to the other two options.
The results in Limongi & Chieffi  provide a final total yield, using this value we calculate the fraction of SLR
emitted relative to the total wind mass loss rate using SeBa to calculate the total mass loss rate before the simulation
begins. The estimated fraction is calculated through an Akima spline interpolation of the data provided in the paper,
which provides a more accurate fit compared to a cubic spline. This fraction can then be used in conjunction with
the simulation mass loss rate from SeBa to approximate the SLR emission rate from massive stars. Whilst directly
calculating the SLR loss rate through their model would yield improved results — as our estimation does not factor in
composition changes in the wind through stellar interior processes such as dredge-up — these issues are offset by the
fact that the majority of the mass loss of early-type stars occurs after they leave the main sequence in a comparatively
short period of time before supernova . This method also works for SLRs beyond 26Al and 60Fe, such as
this paper. Future versions of this code will be able to analyse other SLRs, as the routines governing enrichment and
decay were designed with flexibility in mind.
In the case of supernovae, the total explosive yield of SLRs is provided by Limongi & Chieffi . It is important
to note that the Limongi & Chieffi  model assumes that stars above 25 M⊙collapse directly into a black hole,
producing no supernova explosion and thus resulting in no further enrichment. The debate on this facet of stellar
evolution is still ongoing, the mass border wherein supernovae occur is still somewhat ill-defined, though contemporary
research suggests that supernovae become increasingly rare above 20 M⊙. We
determined that for this paper we would not consider these higher-mass supernovae – in particular due to the rarity
of higher-mass precursor stars – though investigating the effect of higher-mass supernovae on star-forming region
enrichment could be a future avenue of research.
In order to determine the quantity of material swept up by the protoplanetary disk, we must calculate the geometric
cross-section of the disk when interacting with the wind. To perform this calculation we approximate the outflow as a
spherical wind-blown bubble with a constant density. From this we can calculate the sweep-up area, ηsweep, equivalent
to:
ηsweep = 3

majority of the mass loss occurs near the end of each star’s life, as the star exits the main sequences and begins its Wolf-Rayet
phase.
where rdisk is the disk radius, ∆r⋆is the distance travelled by the approaching star during a timestep and rbub is the
bubble radius. Two bubble radii are considered, a small bubble, with a radius of 0.1 pc, and a variable bubble size
with a radius equivalent to the current virial radius of the region. These are representative of a small, local wind , and a diffuse, dispersed stellar wind throughout the region  respectively. The
total effective cross-section from wind absorption, ηwind, is given by the equation:
ηwind = ηconηinjηsweep,
the massive star and the disk, though these represent somewhat conservative values for both ,
with the bubble radius being the most influential free parameter. Finally, we can calculate the mass sweep-up rate,
The “global” and “local” models are run concurrently, as they have no influence on the N-body trajectories nor stellar
evolution of the stars within the star-forming region. Additionally, radioactive decay is modelled as the simulation
runtime is significantly longer than the half-life of either SLR. Decay is calculated by determining the fraction of
remaining SLRs between each timestep, based on the 26Al and 60Fe half-lifes of 0.7 Myr and 2.6 Myr, respectively.
Supernovae enrichment is calculated directly from the supernova yield of the star. All stars within the star-forming
region are instantaneously injected with SLRs. Whilst the outflow material from the supernova would not be travelling
instantaneously, the crossing time of the outflow is on the order of 100 yr, significantly smaller than the smallest
simulation timestep of 2 × 104 yr, and as such this is a reasonable abstraction. The amount of material from the
supernova deposited onto a protoplanetary disk is dependent on the cross-sectional area of the disk relative to the
supernova, such that the geometric efficiency, ηgeom, is:
ηgeom = πr2
disk cos θ
where d is the distance from the approaching star and θ is the disk inclination relative to the massive star. We assume
a constant disk inclination of 60◦, such that cos θ = 0.5. The total supernova SLR absorption efficiency, ηSNe, is given
by the equation:
ηSNe = ηconηinjηgeom,
with the following equation:
ΓSNe,SLR = ηSNeMSNe,SLR,
Enrichment through the “global” model and the supernovae-resultant enrichment are calculated using a post-
processing method which calculates the enrichment rates at each simulation checkpoint, while enrichment through
the “local” model is calculated at the end of each N-body timestep. Both methods are very fast, with post-processing
through the global model taking a few seconds per simulation on a reasonably powerful desktop PC, while the local
model takes 5 −10% of the total computational time per simulation step on the same computer. The main source of
compute time is the calculation of distances between high-mass and low-mass stars. Adding more SLRs for consid-
eration would not impact performance significantly as calculating the enrichment rate is comparatively simple. The
contributions through each model are collated as part of a final post-processing step, which is performed before plots
were made.
We performed repeated simulations with varying star number densities by modifying the star forming region radius
and number of stars within the star-forming region. The number of stars, N⋆is varied between 100, 1000, and 104
stars, in order to observe the effect of star number density  and the compound effect of multiple massive stars
and supernovae. The star-forming region radius is varied between 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 parsecs, to provide representative
examples of extremely compact, compact and dispersed star-forming regions. This correlates to extremely dense and
relatively dispersed star-forming regions, and is done in order to differentiate between effects due to region density and
massive star count. Each set of parameters is repeated 32 times, to reduce the statistical impact of systems enriched
through improbable means such as multiple supernovae passes .
An important factor governing the enrichment of disks within these simulations is that the rate of disk progression
is significantly faster than the average rate of supernovae occurring for any given simulation. Whilst massive stellar
winds make up the bulk of 26Al enrichment, 60Fe enrichment through winds is many orders of magnitude slower,
as enrichment relies more heavily on supernovae, 60Fe enrichment is curtailed. Furthermore, as we make the same
assumption as Limongi & Chieffi  that only stars with an initial mass below 25 M⊙produce supernovae, with
stars higher than this initial mass instead directly collapsing into black holes. As such, enrichment from supernovae
does not occur until ∼7 Myr after the start of the simulation, at a point where only 7% of disks remain, as seen in
Fig. 1.
Table 1 contains detailed statistics of each simulation set, in particular the number of high-mass stars , sim-
ulation supernovae count , fraction of disks undergoing enrichment,  and the fraction of disks that
underwent enough enrichment for significant degassing to occur .
Enrichment calculations are based on the local model.
To calculate the density of a star forming region in these simulations we use the initial median local density . This value is calculated by determining the median value of the stellar density of a sphere
containing the 10 nearest stars to each star in the star forming region at the start of the simulation. Figure 3 compares
the fraction of all disks that underwent any form of enrichment under the local model versus the median local density.
This non-zero enrichment fraction is used to show how likely close passes to massive stars are for disks. We find
that the amount of disks undergoing enrichment for any given simulation is highly dependent on the initial median

Figure 3. A plot of all simulations showing the fraction of all stellar disks that underwent any amount of enrichment from the
local wind model versus initial median local density. We observe a clear dependence on region density, which is more important
than the number of stars in the region, despite simulations with a higher number of stars inherently having more massive stars.
local density of the star forming region. This suggests that a compact, low population star forming region with a
single massive star is potentially ideal for SLR enrichment. Such region masses would be significantly more likely
to occur in nature than higher-mass star forming regions, and the number of low-mass regions containing a single
massive star is similar to the number of higher mass regions that always contain massive stars . Furthermore, the lower massive star count would result in less disk disruption due to ionising photon flux and
supernovae shocks . Even in the case of extremely large numbers of stars,
region radius and density appear to be more influential than star counts in keeping massive stellar winds distant from
disks. It should be noted that the 100-star systems have a higher fraction of massive stars to low mass stars, due to the
minimum simulation requirement of one massive star. The percentage of massive stars in simulations with 100 stars
is ∼1.1% compared to ∼0.25% of the more populous simulations. This can potentially overestimate the amount of
enrichment in a particular system; however, simulating systems without an SLR source would have been redundant.

high value of Z60Fe,SS = 10−6 are used for 60Fe plots . The enrichment values are
calculated at the point where the disk has “progressed” or at the end of the simulation, whichever is shortest. While there
is a higher amount of 26Al enrichment; the primarily supernovae-driven 60Fe enrichment is suppressed as most disks may not
undergo supernovae interaction.
Fig. 4 shows enrichment values calculated at the end of the disk’s lifetime. Wind enrichment is influential, as can be
seen in the 26Al results, as 60Fe enrichment is extremely minimal  through stellar winds. We see that
for low radius star-forming regions there are a significant number of stars with 26Al enrichment greater than the Solar
System estimate, however for regions with a higher radius we see that this drops off rapidly, with only the simulation
set where rc = 1 pc and N⋆= 104 exceeding the Solar System average.
In the case of 60Fe enrichment there is an even greater discrepancy between the two models, as the 60Fe yield from
SNe is multiple orders of magnitude greater than the total wind yield from a massive star, 60Fe enrichment relies almost
entirely on supernovae. As disk population is reduced when supernovae begin to occur  we find that there
is a vanishingly small population of stars that have Solar System-like levels of 60Fe enrichment. The longer half-life of
As we discussed in our previous paper , 60Fe enrichment is only important for the evolution and
desiccation of planetesimals in the case of extremely high levels of enrichment . Our
results in Fig. 4 show that these levels of enrichment would be almost impossible, and nothing even close was observed
in our suite of simulations.
We can infer from these results that disk lifetimes are highly influential in the calculation of SLR enrichment. SLRs
that make up a significant fraction of the stellar wind, such as 26Al, are continuously distributed over the lifespan of

the massive stars within the star-forming region. However, the shorter half-life of 26Al results in significantly skewed
results if the measurement of final 26Al enrichment occurs at the end of the simulation. Furthermore, disks that survive
long enough that a local star enters the Wolf-Rayet phase and goes supernova will see a significantly increased 26Al
enrichment, as well as some 60Fe enrichment.
Fig. 5 shows the results for simulations where the “local” model is used instead, we observe that a greater number
of disks become highly 26Al enriched, and in some cases can be enriched more than two orders of magnitude higher
than the Solar System baseline. However, it should be noted that with the “local” model a disk system can have zero
enrichment, which would not be represented in the violin plot. Enrichment fractions of disks for each simulation set
are shown in Table 1. This enrichment fraction is shown in more detail in Fig. 6, where we can clearly see a small
fraction of disks in compact star-forming regions being enriched to above-Solar System amounts, even in the case of
regions with a low overall population of stars. Above-Solar System enrichment can occur in star-forming regions with
a higher initial radius, though this is significantly less likely, and is similarly independent of the total number of stars
in the region. The total number of systems undergoing 60Fe enrichment is similarly changed, as the SLR flux onto
a disk is significantly increased in the local model when a disk is proximal to a massive star. However, this effect
does not drastically increase the number of systems with Solar System-like levels of 60Fe, which is still dominated by

supernovae rather than stellar winds, and as such the impact of accounting for disk lifetimes has a more marked effect
on enrichment than the wind model.
From previous work in Lichtenberg et al.  and Eatson et al.  it is found that 26Al is highly important
in the process of planetesimal desiccation, with enrichment levels greater than 0.1 × Z26Al,SS causing a reduction in
final water retention fraction of larger early planetesimals. Table 1 shows that only a small fraction of disks gain this
level of enrichment, requiring compact, dense star-forming regions. The main outlier is the simulation set of regions
with 104 stars and radii of 0.3 pc; these super-dense star-forming regions frequently produce highly enriched disks,
though occurrence of such massive star-forming regions is rare, and also the large number of supernovae that occur
would result in significant disk disruption . It is also important to note that at a radius of
counts and supernovae counts, as these values are inclusive of supernovae deposition. 60Fe enrichment is markedly less
influential to planetesimal evolution, due to the radioisotopes lower decay rate, decay energy and disk mass fraction.
In our previous paper we found that extreme levels of 60Fe enrichment  are required to produce
the level of heating that results in dessication . We find in this paper that Solar System levels of
enrichment are unlikely, let alone enrichment to 103 times Solar System amounts. This further rules out 60Fe as an
influential SLR for planetesimal heating, and the lack of 60Fe enrichment to Solar System amounts in our simulations
suggests the presence of alternative mechanisms of 60Fe enrichment beyond supernovae — such as AGB stars . Finally, comparing this result to previous work such as Parker et al.  we find that 26Al
contribution from stellar winds is very significant, and that stellar density is very important. As we vary both the star
forming region and total population we find that more compact star forming regions produce greater levels of both

Comparing the disks generated in this simulation with the Solar protoplanetary disk, we find that initial Solar System
abundances for both 26Al and 60Fe do occur, but are typically less common. This suggests that the Solar System is
on the upper-end of SLR enrichment, except in the case of very dense, populous  star-forming regions.
These results also suggest that the probability of ocean worlds is relatively high, as radioisotopic heating would be
insufficient to cause significant devolatilization in planetesimals, resulting in a significantly higher water budget for a
would be necessary to estimate the population of ocean worlds in more detail. In recent years the physical cause of
the density dichotomy between super-Earths and sub-Neptune exoplanets has come under closer scrutiny by formation
models that involve water enrichment during the disk phase  instead of
solely relying on post-disk atmospheric escape. Hence, a population synthesis or statistical approach involving 26Al
desiccation with more modern formation models  appears a natural extension for future
work to interpret the growing data from the low-mass exoplanet census .
Star count does not particularly increase the maximum 26Al enrichment, though can result in more disks being
significantly enriched; instead we find that star-forming region mass density significantly affects the final disk enrich-
ment. This is the case even with the “global” wind model, as the rate of SLR deposition is significantly curtailed
as the bubble radius is larger. In the more common case of compact, low mass star-forming regions, we find that
around 5% of disks have undergone levels of enrichment on the order of our Solar System, enough for 26Al decay
heating to have a pronounced effect on planetesimal evolution, particularly affecting retained water fraction. Whilst
massive stellar winds and supernovae are a prominent source of SLRs, the adverse affects of UV photoevaporation
and supernovae shocks can disrupt disks before planetesimals form , making 
star-forming regions with fewer massive stars more conducive to planet formation. As such, the combination of high
levels of SLRs in lower population star-forming regions would result in more water poor rocky planets. Incorporating
disk progression and measuring the final enrichment from the moment the disk has decayed is a more accurate method
of determining enrichment, and in the case of 26Al with its significantly shorter half-life, this can significantly impact
results compared to an observation at an arbitrary time or the end of the simulation. In the case of 60Fe however we
find that supernova-based enrichment is severely inhibited by the disk lifetime typically being significantly shorter than
the lifetime of high-mass stars. We find that by the time supernovae begin to occur only a quarter of protoplanetary
disks remain , this is also seen in our results where disk “decay” skews the 60Fe yields down more than any
contributing factor. This is further inhibited when factoring in high-mass stars failing to undergo supernovae. These
results are corroborated by the findings of Williams & Gaidos  and Gounelle & Meibom , whose results
suggest a similar unlikelihood of Solar System level enrichment, and only in large clusters with very high mass stars.
The “R” model described in Limongi & Chieffi  assumes that direct black hole collapse occurs when a star
with an initial mass greater than 25 M⊙dies, resulting in zero SLR yield. At the point where these contributing
supernovae begin to occur, less than 10% of all disks remain, resulting in further inhibited 60Fe enrichment. Whilst
our model does not take into account mixed-age stellar populations, we do not believe that this would significantly
impact our results, and would be offset by other unsimulated interactions, such as evaporation of disks from UV flux
from massive stars and supernovae shocks . Furthermore, the “low”  60Fe solar
system estimate from Tang & Dauphas  can be explained through processes such as residual galactic chemical
evolution; this mechanism does not explain the higher enrichment levels determined by other studies, such as Mishra
et al.  and Cook et al. . It appears unlikely that these higher estimates can be explained purely through
supernovae. Alternative 60Fe injection mechanisms such as interloping AGB stars could prove a suitable explanation
for this discrepancy .
In this paper we performed a series of simulations to determine typical enrichment rates of star-forming regions for
specific densities and stellar populations. Results differ from previous work ,
as whilst we observe a similar amount of 26Al enrichment, the local wind model produces a higher number of disks
undergoing 26Al enrichment significant enough to influence planetary evolution. Much of the changes in enrichment
compared to previous work are due to the length of time required for supernovae to occur, which is much longer than
the average time a disk needs to progress. Stratification of enrichment from varying simulation parameters is very
clear, with enrichment increasing with star-forming region mass density. We also find that enrichment method and
disk model are particularly influential on the final SLR enrichment amount. 26Al enrichment is primarily through wind
deposition — as this is relatively consistent for either model assuming the system is sufficiently populous or dense
deposition, and as such enrichment to Solar System levels is unlikely, and enrichment to levels where 60Fe is the
dominant heating source of planetesimals is almost non-existent.
In the immediate future, including additional SLR sources such as from “interloping” AGB stars would provide an
interesting comparison. As 60Fe is formed in the core of more massive AGB stars and can be efficiently dredged up
and deposited via the stellar wind – this could result in another avenue of 60Fe enrichment in lieu of the relatively
ineffective massive stellar wind mechanism .
