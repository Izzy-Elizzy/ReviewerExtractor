This year marks half a century since Stephen Hawking made his greatest scientific dis-
covery by theoretically proving that “black holes ain’t so black”, as they behave like hot
bodies with an absolute temperature that depends inversely on their mass. This discovery
is expressed by a simple and elegant equation known as the Hawking temperature. The
best way to commemorate this great scientific event is by bringing it to a wide audience.
The simplest and most transparent and intuitive tool to achieve this goal is dimensional
analysis. The objective of this work is to use this tool to derive the Hawking equation,
reveal its meaning, and explore its main physical consequences.

This year marks half a century since Stephen Hawking revolutionised physics by proposing,
in 1974, that “black holes ain’t so black” . Specifically, Hawking theoretically
demonstrated that a black hole emits thermal radiation as if it were a hot body with an
absolute temperature TH, known as the Hawking temperature , which can be calculated
by the equation:

was formulated, it continues to be unknown, and at best misunderstood, by the vast majority
of people.

The best way to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Hawking’s discovery is to bring it
to a wide audience. The simplest and most transparent and intuitive tool for this task is
dimensional analysis , the application of which requires a minimal knowledge of physics
and mathematics. In this work, we will use dimensional analysis to carry out an original
derivation of the Hawking temperature. Following this, we will explore the meaning of this
equation and its main physical consequences, namely that black holes evaporate and have
entropy.
This manuscript may be useful to gifted high school students, physics teachers, scientists and
engineers, and, more generally, to any educated person who is interested in learning about
Stephen Hawking’s most important scientific contribution.
Figure 1: Stephen Hawking, born in 1942, was a renowned British theoretical physicist known for his
contributions to cosmology and black hole physics. His greatest scientific discovery was the equation
that established that black holes behave as hot bodies with an absolute temperature that depends
inversely on their mass. Despite facing progressive motor paralysis caused by Lou Gehrig’s disease,
Hawking continued to research and communicate his revolutionary ideas until his death in 2018.
Black holes and Hawking’s discovery
Black holes are the most extreme prediction of general relativity, which is the theory of gravity
proposed by Einstein to refine and extend Newton’s law of gravitation . A black hole is a
region of space where there is such a high concentration of matter that nothing can escape
its powerful gravity, not even light . The simplest of these objects is the so-called static
black hole, whose mathematical description depends only on its mass. Eq.  applies to
these objects, so we will focus on them here.
Fig. 2 shows an intuitive representation of a static black hole . The mass of this object is
concentrated in a point region called a singularity, located in the centre of the event horizon,
or simply horizon, which is a spherical surface that defines the outer limit of the black hole.
Although the horizon has no material existence, it can be imagined as a unidirectional mem-
brane that only allows matter or energy to flow inward . The radius of the horizon, called
the gravitational radius , is calculated as :
Rg = 2GMBH
mass of the black hole, that is, the mass confined in the singularity. Since nothing can cross
the horizon to the outside, this region appears completely black. If the description provided
by general relativity is correct, we see that the laws of thermodynamics ensure that the tem-
perature of the horizon is strictly zero; otherwise, the black hole would emit thermal radiation
and would not be black.
Figure 2: Structure of a static black hole.
Broadly speaking, this is the classic black hole paradigm that emerges from general relativ-
ity. In 1974, when Hawking entered the scene, no one questioned this paradigm. However,
Hawking dared to question it, proving that “black holes ain’t so black”. Specifically, Hawking
proved that the horizon behaves as a hot body with an absolute temperature TH, the Hawking
temperature , which is proportional to the gravity at the horizon.

As a consequence, the horizon emits thermal radiation in all directions, the so-called Hawking
radiation .
According to Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence, the energy radiated
by the black hole leads to a gradual reduction of MBH and RS through a process called
evaporation . Furthermore, from the laws of thermodynamics, this implies that a black
hole has entropy, which turns out to be proportional to the area of the horizon. From Eq.

a microscopic level, and thermodynamics, which describes thermal phenomena . Table 1
shows the fundamental physical constants that characterise these theories, which will be very
useful when dimensionally deriving the Hawking temperature.

Derivation of the Hawking temperature
All the physics we need for a dimensional derivation of the Hawking temperature is sum-
marised in Tables 1 and 2, and in the idea that the description of a static black hole depends
only on its mass. We will start by assuming that we do not know the Hawking equation. Ob-
viously, our ignorance on the subject cannot be complete: in fact, to carry out a dimensional
derivation, it is always necessary to start with a hypothesis about the dimensional parameters
involved  .
To formulate our hypothesis, we must keep in mind that Hawking’s great achievement was to
combine general relativity with quantum mechanics and thermodynamics to demonstrate that
a static black hole has an absolute temperature TH. As shown in Table 1, this suggests that
TH depends on the characteristic constants of these three theories, G, c, ℏ, k. On the other
hand, we also know that a static black hole is completely characterised by its mass, MBH.
This shows us that a total of six dimensional parameters are involved, TH, G, c, ℏ, k, MBH,
and four dimensions, M, L, T, Θ. However, we can reduce these parameters to five, and thus
simplify the dimensional derivation of TH, by introducing a new variable which in astrophysics
is known as the standard gravitational parameter, and for a celestial body of mass m is defined
as µ ≡Gm. The usefulness of this parameter lies in the fact that in problems where gravity
applies, as is the case with Hawking’s discovery, the product Gm appears frequently1.
that the use of µ is essential to this derivation. Indeed, with p = 6 parameters  and d = 4
dimensions , the number of dimensionless groups or Pi groups that can be formed is d −p = 2,

Under these conditions, if we define the standard gravitational parameter as µ ≡GMBH, we
can formulate our hypothesis in the form:
Hypothesis: TH = f.
The specific information needed to derive the Hawking equation is summarised in Table 3,
which contains the dimensional parameters, their symbols, and the corresponding dimensions.
We can rewrite our hypothesis in the form:
TH = Πcx1ℏx2kx3µx4,
unknown, and our main objective is to determine their numerical values. Starting from the
rules of dimensional algebra, and remembering that the notation  means “the dimension of
x” , we can rewrite Eq.  as:
five parameters listed in Table 3, we obtain:
M0L0T 0Θ1 =
M0L0T 0Θ1 = M0x1+x2+x3+0x4Lx1+2x2+2x3+3x4T −x1−x2−2x3−2x4Θ0x1+0x2−x3+0x4.
exponent on the left side, producing a linear system of four equations with four unknowns:
x1 + 2x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 = 0
d = 5 parameters, and since the number of dimensions remains d = 4, the number of Pi groups is reduced to
d −p = 1, and the equation for TH is uniquely determined.
By substitution, the reader can verify that the solution of this system is x1 = 3, x2 = 1, x3 =
TH = Πℏc3
kµ = Π
Eqs.  and  we see that Π = 1/8π. The interested reader can find other simple derivations
of the Hawking temperature in .
The physical meaning of Hawking’s discovery: The Hawking
Hawking temperature is not an isolated result, as it has two physical implications that continue
to raise questions: the first is that black holes evaporate, and the second is that they have
entropy.
To understand these two important results in general terms, we must begin by
exploring the physical meaning of the Hawking temperature.

Black holes have an absolute temperature TH that depends
inversely on their mass MBH. The greater the value of MBH,
the lower the value ofTH, and vice versa. For known black
holes, TH is undetectable.

Black holes evaporate in a characteristic time tev that de-

Bekenstein-Hawking
SBH = kc3ABH
Black holes have an entropy SBH that depends on the hori-
zon area ABH, which is proportional to the square of the
mass. The maximum entropy that can accumulate in a re-
gion of fixed size is that of the largest black hole confined in
said region.
Table 4 summarises the equations that describe the Hawking effect, which is the name given
to the set of phenomena associated with Hawking’s discovery. The interested reader will find
very simple derivations of these equations in . In the following sections, we will delve into
the Hawking effect. Due to space limitations, we will not analyse the physical mechanism
responsible for the Hawking temperature.
A reader interested in this topic can refer to
Hawking’s texts , or other works published in this journal, where this topic is addressed
in an accessible way .
Hawking temperature
The first aspect that we must keep in mind in relation to the Hawking temperature is that it
does not depend on the interaction of the black hole with the matter in its environment. A
black hole could be completely isolated and still have a temperature given by Eq. .
We will start by rewriting this equation in a form that allows for quick calculations, using the
values of G, c, ℏ, k from Table 1. If we enter the solar mass M⊙= 1.99 × 1030kg, and multiply
the right side of Eq.  by the dimensionless quotient M⊙/1.99 × 1030kg = 1, we obtain the
Hawking temperature expressed in kelvin  as:
TH = 6.17 × 10−8K
region of its horizon contains no matter or radiation. This equation tells us that “black holes
ain’t so black”, and that they can be very bright and hot if MBH is small enough. To provide
empirical corroboration of Hawking’s discovery, we need to find light black holes. The lightest
ones that have been observed so far have masses of the order of ∼M⊙, while the heaviest
ones can have masses of up to ∼1010M⊙. To obtain an upper bound for TH, we take
MBH = M⊙in Eq. , obtaining TH = 6.17×10−8K. This tiny temperature is undetectable
through astronomical observations.
Figure 4: Graph of Hawking temperature, TH, versus MBH/M⊙.
To illustrate the relationship between TH and MBH more clearly, a graph of Eq.  is shown
in Fig. 4. The horizontal axis has dimensionless units of MBH/M⊙and the vertical axis has
units of 6.17 × 10−8K. It can be observed that TH approaches zero asymptotically as MBH
increases.
Hawking radiation and evaporation
As with any hot body, a black hole emits mainly photons; that is, Hawking radiation is ba-
sically light. However, if TH is high enough, it can also emit neutrinos, electrons, positrons,
etc. This emission process is known as evaporation . Just as the evaporation of a puddle
of water on a summer day gradually reduces the mass of the puddle, Hawking radiation grad-
ually reduces the mass of the black hole, as the photons, electrons, and other particles cross
the horizon to the outside.
Eq.  reveals that the smaller the value of MBH, the more Hawking radiation is emitted
from the horizon, and the more radiation is emitted, the more rapidly MBH is reduced. This
means that evaporation does not occur at a constant rate, but instead increases over time
when they emit more material than they absorb that there will there be a net outward flow
of radiation that will reduce MBH. The time taken for the mass of an isolated black hole of
initial mass MBH to be reduced to zero is called the evaporation time :
tev ∼= 103 G2M3
sionless quotient 3 = 1, the evaporation time is expressed in seconds 
as:
tev = 1073s
M⊙
the vertical axis has units of 1073s. It can be observed that tev increases rapidly with an
increase in MBH.
Eq.  reveals that, in general, tev is extraordinarily large. To obtain a lower bound for tev,
we take MBH = M⊙in Eq. , obtaining tev ∼= 1073s. This figure is 56 orders of magnitude
greater than the age of the universe, which is estimated at ∼1017s. Hence, evaporation is
unobservable, which is consistent with the fact that TH is undetectable.
Figure 5: Graph of evaporation time, tev, versus MBH/M⊙.
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
The laws of thermodynamics establish that every body with a non-zero temperature has
entropy, and black holes are no exception. According to calculations originally carried out
by the physicist Jacob Bekenstein and perfected by Hawking , the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy SBH of an isolated black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon:
SBH = kc3ABH
the black hole and the solar mass:
SBH = 4πkGM2
M⊙
where we have introduced the values of the constants and multiplied the right side of the
equality by the dimensionless quotient 2 = 1, allowing SBH to be expressed
in joules/kelvin , which are the SI units of entropy. Fig. 6 shows a graph of this
equation, where the horizontal axis has units of MBH/M⊙and the vertical axis units of
gives SBH = 1.5 × 1054J · K−1. This is a colossal number, and reveals that black holes are
among the most entropic objects in the universe.
Figure 6: Graph of entropy, SBH, versus MBH/M⊙.
Analogue gravity
If, as the evidence suggests, the smallest black holes have masses on the order of ∼M⊙, with
Hawking temperatures on the order of a millionth of a kelvin, attempts to detect Hawking
radiation may be unsuccessful. To get around this difficulty, the ideal would be to create
black holes in our laboratories, which would allow us to study them in detail, but this is
obviously impossible with current technology , and it may never be possible to develop
such technology.
Due to these difficulties, some specialists have turned their attention towards a field of ex-
perimental physics called analogue gravity, whose objective is implementing physical systems
that imitate the behaviour of gravitational phenomena that are difficult to observe under real
conditions , such as the Hawking effect.
The first person to propose the use of analogue models to study black holes was the Canadian
theoretical physicist William Unruh, who, in 1972, introduced an inventive analogy: he imag-
ined a fish screaming while falling over a waterfall. As the fish falls, it heads toward a point in
the waterfall where the water travels downward faster than sound waves can travel upward.
When the fish crosses this point, its friends in the river above can no longer hear it, since
to enable this, the speed of the sound waves would have to exceed the speed of sound in the
water . According to Unruh, this is analogous to what would happen to an astronaut
who fell into the jaws of a black hole: the astronaut would not be able to communicate with
the base station on Earth, because the signals sent towards the outside would need to move
faster than light, which is prohibited by physical laws.
Figure 7: A fish sends sound waves up a waterfall. The dashed line is an analogue of the horizon,
where the speed with which the waterfall falls is equal to the speed of sound in the water, meaning
that the waves cannot cross the dashed line.
Almost a decade later, Unruh showed that the event horizons of black holes and the sonic
horizons in systems such as his waterfall, which are now known as sonic black holes, can be
described by identical equations . In particular, Unruh showed that sonic black holes can
mimic the Hawking temperature and Hawking radiation. The results of the first experiment
of this type were published in 2014 , so this is a new and developing field of research. The
results obtained so far are encouraging, although not conclusive, and the evidence is consistent
with the discoveries made by Hawking half a century ago.
Final comments: Epitaph for a genius
The great discoveries of physics are expressed through equations that accurately describe a
wide range of phenomena. Some equations stand out for their simplicity, others for their
elegance, and others for their ability to build bridges between apparently dissimilar domains
of reality. However, there is a select group of equations that stand out for combining all these
virtues.
For example, Newton’s law of gravitation falls into this category, as it reconciles celestial
physics with terrestrial physics, as does Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence, which unifies
matter and energy. The Hawking equation also falls into this category, as it bridges general
relativity, quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Hawking’s tomb in Westminster Abbey
has this equation engraved on it, alongside the inscription: “Here lies what was mortal of
Stephen Hawking”. It is hoped that this work will contribute to a better understanding of
Hawking’s work and his immortal equation, a symbol of a scientific revolution that is far from
over.
Appendix: Dimensional analysis and dimensional algebra
A physical dimension, briefly called a dimension, is a property of an object or phenomenon
that can be measured and expressed in terms of standard fundamental units. Dimensional
analysis is a tool used in science and engineering to study and relate different physical quanti-
ties through their dimensions. For example, length, mass, and time are dimensions that have
associated SI units of the metre, kilogram, and second, respectively. There are seven dimen-
sions, which correspond to the seven fundamental physical magnitudes. These dimensions,
their symbols, and the associated SI units appear in Table A1 below.
In the various applications of dimensional analysis, the notation  is commonly used, which
is read as “the dimensions of a”. For example, if m is the mass of any object, ρ is its density
and v is its speed, we have  = M,  = ML−3 and  = LT −1.

To apply dimensional analysis, it is useful to systematise seven principles that, together, we
can call the rules of dimensional algebra. We can consider a set of quantities a, b, c... that
may be pure numbers, variables, physical constants, etc. The rules of dimensional algebra
that can be applied to these quantities are as follows:
i Product rule:  = .
ii Quotient rule:  = /.
iii Commutativity rule:  = .
iv Associativity rule:  = .
v Powers rule:  = n.
vi Homogeneity rule: If a ± b = c then  =  =  = .
vii Dimensionless quantities rule: If a is dimensionless, then  = 1.
