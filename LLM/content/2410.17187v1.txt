We present a catalog of unobscured QSO candidates in the southern hemisphere from the early in-
terim data of the KMTNet Synoptic Survey of Southern Sky . The KS4 data covers ∼2500 deg2
sky area, reaching 5σ detection limits of ∼22.1–22.7 AB mag in the BV RI bands. Combining this
with available infrared photometric data from the surveys covering the southern sky, we select the
unobscured QSO candidates based on their colors and spectral energy distributions  fitting
results. The final catalog contains 72,964 unobscured QSO candidates, of which only 0.4 % are previ-
ously identified as QSOs based on spectroscopic observations. Our selection method achieves an 87 %
recovery rate for spectroscopically confirmed bright QSOs at z < 2 within the KS4 survey area. In
addition, the number count of our candidates is comparable to that of spectroscopically confirmed
QSOs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the northern sky. These demonstrate that our approach
is effective in searching for unobscured QSOs in the southern sky. Future spectro-photometric surveys
covering the southern sky will enable us to discern their true nature and enhance our understanding
of QSO populations in the southern hemisphere.

Furthermore, there is a substantial interest not only
in investigating the properties of individual objects but
also in understanding the demography of QSOs. This
includes statistical analysis of QSO populations, exam-
ining their distribution in space and time , and analyzing luminos-
ity functions to trace cosmic evolution , alongside the
corresponding black hole mass functions and distribu-
tions of Eddington ratio . Unobscured QSOs ac-
count for a significant portion of the total QSO popula-
tion, making them valuable for such studies . Therefore, surveys of unobscured QSOs
are essential, as they contribute to our understanding
of both cosmic evolution and the mechanisms underly-
ing the growth of SMBHs .
Despite significant advancements in QSO surveys over
the past two decades , the explo-
ration of QSOs in the southern hemisphere remains in-
complete.
For example, Croom et al.  spectro-
scopically discovered ∼10K QSOs in a field of a limited
area  in the southern
hemisphere. Onken et al.  found 156 spectroscop-
ically identified QSOs from the All-sky BRIght Com-
plete Quasar Survey , based on the com-
bination of All-sky space missions. In addition, Yang &
Shen  utilized optical photometric data 
from the Dark Energy Survey  to
search for the photometric QSO candidates in the south-
ern hemisphere.
Some studies have been more dedicated to exploring
the particular area, the south ecliptic pole field, using
optical imaging data . This re-
gion will be extensively explored by several survey mis-
sions, such as Euclid ,
Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe,
Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer , eROSITA , and
poral survey data in the study of AGN physical prop-
erties, it is vital to pre-select the bright AGN in the
southern hemisphere.
Using a network of three KMTNet 1.6-m telescopes
in Chile, Australia, and South Africa ,
an optical imaging survey called the KMTNet Synoptic
Survey of Southern Sky  is underway. This survey
commenced on November 29, 2019. It aims to image up
to 7000 square degrees of the sky visible from the south-
ern hemisphere  in four optical bands
depths of ∼22.1–22.7 mag. It is noteworthy that the
survey area has not been fully covered by DES. The pri-
mary science goal is to identify the optical counterparts
of gravitational wave triggers and to study kilonovae in
their early stages .
We plan to roll out Data Release 1 in late 2024, which
will be accompanied by a journal paper on the survey
bilities compared to other southern sky surveys, such as
SkyMapper Southern Survey , KS4
is expected to facilitate the discovery of more QSO can-
didates that were previously missed. The early interim
data, which covers the sky area of ∼2500 deg2 , are currently available only to internal collaborators
for research and verification. Leveraging this early data,
we aim to compile a catalog of unobscured QSO candi-
dates, serving as groundwork for future survey missions.
The QSO selection solely based on the optical col-
ors has some limitations due to contaminators, such as
early type stars or star-forming galaxies. On the other
hand, mid-infrared  colors are particularly effec-
tive in identifying QSO candidates , largely because the MIR light is emit-
ted from the hot or warm dust surrounding SMBHs, as
posited by the unified AGN model . However, since MIR wavelengths
are less affected by dust extinction, relying solely on
MIR colors can lead to a mixed sample of both unob-
scured and obscured QSOs. The integration of optical
data significantly enhances the selection of unobscured
QSOs . There-
fore, we utilize a multi-wavelength dataset, including the
KS4 data, to specifically target the identification of un-
obscured QSOs in the southern sky.
In this paper, we present the catalog of unobscured
QSO candidates in the southern hemisphere, selected
from the KS4 interim data.
The KS4 data and pho-
tometry are described in Section 2. In Section 3, we de-
scribe how the unobscured QSO candidates are selected,
and the validation of the candidate selection is given in
Section 4.
Through this paper, we adopt the canon-
ically used cosmological parameters for the standard
ΛCDM universe: H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.3
and ΩΛ = 0.7. All the magnitudes are given in the AB
system unless exceptions are noted.
The data used in this work consists of object catalogs
from BV RI stacked images for 638 KS4 tiles .
Each pre-defined tile covers a total field of 2
degree × 2 degree, matching the field-of-view of the
KMTNet camera . Observations were
made using three identical 1.6-m telescopes between late
November 2019 and January 2022. We prioritized ob-

servations in areas of the sky excluding the Large Mag-
ellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, low Galactic lat-
itude regions , and the regions already cov-
ered by the DES .
Because of the alti-
tude limit of KMTNet, the Decl. < −85◦regions are
excluded as well. The basic survey strategy is straight-
forward: each tile is observed with a 120-second expo-
sure per visit, with a total combined exposure time of at
least 480 seconds. Each raw image consists of an array
of four e2v CCDs 
with a pixel scale of 0.4 arcsec. To fill the CCD gaps in
the vertical  and horizontal 
directions, we use a four-point dithering pattern with
offsets of about 4 and 7 arcmin in RA and Dec, respec-
tively. This dithering pattern results in heterogeneous
image depths across the CCD gap and edge regions of
each tile.
The data were pre-processed at the KMTNet data cen-
ter in Daejeon, Korea, including overscan and crosstalk
corrections, bias subtraction, and flat fielding. A bad
pixel mask is generated by identifying pixels that are
affected by cosmic-ray hits on the detector, crosstalks
from saturated pixels in an associated amplifier , and regions that are unusable due to in-
herent defects in the CCD. The pre-processed data then
undergoes zero-point  scaling to a uniform value
of ZP = 30 mag, eliminating spatially variable ZPs
across the field. For astrometric calibration, we utilize
the SCAMP software  to derive an accurate
World Coordinate System  solution, using Gaia
EDR3  as the reference
catalog. This method achieves a root-mean-square er-
ror of 0.026 arcsec in both RA and Dec relative to the
reference catalog WCS.
The KS4 stacking procedure involves using the SWarp
software  to combine the pre-processed im-
ages. We employ a tangential projection method and a
median combine technique to produce the final stacked
images. Additionally, the FSCALASTRO parameter is set
to VARIABLE to adjust for spatial variations in the pixel
scale of KMTNet images, ensuring accurate flux rescal-
ing throughout the field. The average seeing sizes of the
combined images are about 2.10, 2.03, 1.94, and 1.93
arcsec in the BV RI bands, respectively.
The photometric calibration of the images is per-
formed using APASS DR9  and
SkyMapper DR3  catalogs as
reference data, with the following calibration equations:
B = BAPASS −0.06 −0.27 × 
V = VAPASS + 0.02
R = rAPASS + 0.0383 −0.3718 × 
I = iSMSS + 0.011 −0.243 × 
In the above, BAPASS and VAPASS are in Vega mag-
nitudes, while the others are in the AB system. The
references for these conversion equations are as follows:
the B and V conversion equations are from Park et al.
I is derived by comparing KMTNet images taken in the
COSMOS field with the SMSS catalog of the same field.
For point sources brighter than 17 mag, the average
uncertainties of KS4 photometric calibration are 0.026,
spectively. Correspondingly, the final 5σ imaging depths
are B = 22.75, V = 22.60, R = 22.80, and I = 22.09
mag, which are comparable to those of the preceding
QSO survey with KMTNet data . The
saturation levels are 12.95, 13.07, 13.77, and 13.60 mag,
respectively.
Source detection was performed on the KS4 I-
band images with a signal-to-noise ratio criterion of
MAG AUTO SNR I> 1.
Subsequently, we extracted the
flux of sources in each band image using the dual mode
of SExtractor . We primarily
use the MAG AUTO estimates from the SExtractor, which
measure flux within an adaptively scaled aperture. This
approach is due to variations in the point spread func-
tion  depending on the source’s position in the
image.
To utilize infrared photometric data in the follow-
ing analysis, we crossmatch the KS4 catalog with ex-
ternal catalogs from the infrared surveys covering the
KS4 area: Two Micron All Sky Survey , VISTA Hemisphere Survey , and Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer . For each KS4 ob-
ject, we identify potential counterparts by searching for
the nearest neighbor source in external catalogs, rely-
ing solely on its coordinates. Considering the imaging
resolution of the surveys, we tested several cases and
established the matching radii for 2MASS, VHS, and
WISE as 2.0, 1.0, and 2.0 arcsecs, respectively.
The 2MASS point source catalog  provides de-
fault magnitudes for the J, H, and Ks bands , representing the optimal measurements for each
band.
Although 2MASS is an all-sky survey, its de-
tection limits are relatively shallow, with 5σ detection
limits for a point source at 17.4, 17.2, and 16.9 mag,
respectively. To enhance our depth of detection, we also
utilize J, H, and Ks magnitudes from VHS, specifically
the 2 arcsec diameter aperture magnitudes , which achieve 5σ detection
limits of 21.5, 21.2, and 20.3 mag, respectively. Note
that VHS coverage in the H-band is limited to the south
galactic cap. When a source appears in both 2MASS
and VHS, we prioritize the VHS magnitudes, resorting
to 2MASS only when VHS data is unavailable.
Among the various versions of WISE data, we use the
W1, W2, W3, and W4 magnitudes from the AllWISE
catalog . The magnitudes are mea-
sured with profile-fitting photometry  and their 5σ detection limits are 19.6,
To convert the Vega magnitudes to AB magnitudes,
the following papers and conversion factors are refer-
enced: Blanton et al.  for 2MASS JHKs bands
VHS JHKs bands , and Cutri et al.
For the final catalog, we perform the galactic extinc-
tion correction by utilizing sfdmap Python package1.
Following the default setting, we use the dust map by
Schlegel et al.  with a scaling factor of 0.86 from
Schlafly & Finkbeiner .
These corrections are
made under the assumption of RV = 3.1.
We initially eliminate unreliable sources flagged by
the KS4 data processing pipeline. These flagged sources
typically arise from spurious signals, such as crosstalk,
blended light from bright sources, and instrumental
hot/bad pixels . As mentioned in Section 2, each
KS4 field was intentionally dithered at least four times.
To ensure data homogeneity, we select objects observed
at least four times in every band, using the NDITH flags
in the KS4 catalog . Then, the effective
survey area size decreases, as shown by the red patches
in Figure 1.
Our source detection was conducted in the I-band im-
ages, hence there are numerous sources beyond the 5σ
imaging depths in the other bands, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. For reliable source selection, we apply an addi-
tional signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 5 in the I-band
of I ≲21 mag.
Note that the SNRs are simply de-
termined by taking the reciprocal of magnitude errors.
The imposition of this additional SNR criterion in the
I-band  marginally reduces the number
of sources. The B-band and WISE detections are also
important in the QSO selection below, so we give ad-
ditional criteria for them: SNRB > 2, SNRW1 > 2,
SNRW2 > 2, and SNRW3 > 2. Further imposing these
SNR criteria results in a significant reduction in the
source count , while the numbers of
bright sources  are relatively less affected
by these criteria. This is due to the remaining bright
stars after the selection. Indeed, most of the remaining
bright sources have blue MIR colors ,
implying that they are not likely to be QSOs.
We distinguish QSOs from stellar objects and inactive
galaxies by their MIR colors; QSOs exhibit redder MIR
colors due to the hot dust emissions reprocessing light
from accretion disks. We adopt the AGN selection cri-
teria based on WISE colors of X-ray-detected sources as
proposed by Mateos et al. :
Mateos et al.  defined these criteria in the Vega
magnitude system.
We applied the Vega-to-AB con-
version factors as per the AllWISE data , with a minor discrepancy  from those
used in Mateos et al. .
Note that most X-ray-
detected sources in Mateos et al.  are at z < 2,

photometry in the I-band yields flux measurements of numerous sources beyond the 5σ imaging depths, as indicated by the
vertical dotted lines in each panel. The red histograms represent the marginal reduction in source count after applying an SNR
criterion in the I-band. The blue histograms show the decrease in numbers when applying additional SNR criteria across the
B/W1/W2/W3 bands. Note that the sudden increase in number at I ≲16 mag is due to the bright stars that remain after the
SNR cut. The shaded regions denote the ranges of saturated magnitudes.

the same increment, also moving outward from the center. The squares indicate the spectroscopically confirmed QSOs from the

where their hot dust components are observable within
the W1-to-W3 bands. The left panel of Figure 3 shows
the WISE color-color diagram relevant to the selec-
tion wedge .
Accompanying this are the
color distributions of spectroscopically confirmed type-1
from Lyke et al.  and Reyes et al. , respec-
tively. As this selection wedge is determined by X-ray
detection, it effectively captures both type-1 and type-2
QSOs. Our objective is to refine the selection to un-
obscured QSOs; thus, we impose an additional criterion
based on the optical-MIR colors to reflect the bluer opti-
cal spectral shape of unobscured QSOs, following Byun
et al. :
Note that this criterion is converted to the AB magni-
tude system, while the previously proposed criterion is
given in the Vega magnitude system .
The right panel in Figure 3 presents the color distri-
butions incorporating B-band magnitudes. This fourth
criterion, shown as the black solid lines, more accurately
differentiates between type-1 and type-2 QSOs. Indeed,
criteria, whereas a mere 6.2 % of the type-2 QSOs from
Reyes et al.  do so. It is noteworthy that the selec-
tion of type-2 QSOs may be skewed by the small sample
size  relative to type-1 QSOs . We also note that our selection criteria are highly
effective for identifying type-1 QSOs up to z ∼2, with
a recovery rate of 95 %. The recovery rate drops signif-
icantly to 7 % at z ∼3.3, indicating that these criteria
are primarily suited for the identification of low-redshift
type-1 QSOs. This is because high-redshift QSOs ex-
hibit faint flux at the B band and may not be detected
in the W3 band. We further discuss the selection effi-
ciency of spectroscopically confirmed QSOs within the
KS4 field in Section 4.1.
Consequently, employing the above selection criteria
yields 106,443 QSO candidates over the KS4 survey area.
Because the photometric selection solely with broad-
band photometry can lead to including a large portion
of non-QSOs, we carry out the SED fitting on the pre-
selected sources in order to further perform the rigorous
classification. The detailed method is described in Son
et al.  and Byun et al. . The photometric
data obtained from KS4, 2MASS, VHS, and WISE is
used for the analysis. We adopt LePhare++2, a C++ ren-
dition of the original Fortran program LePhare , which allows us to fit
the SED with various sets of SED templates. We ini-
tially employ three AGN templates from Lyu & Rieke
in mid-infrared: normal, hot dust-deficient, and warm
dust-deficient AGNs. In addition, we consider the emis-
sion from the polar dust with extinction  on the AGN continuum. Finally, the contribution
from the host galaxies, which is modeled with 7 types of
SWIRE galaxies   is added. The flux ratio of the host to
the total flux at 1.6 µm is set to be 1 −95%. Finally,
estimation of the COSMOS survey 
and the stellar templates from Bohlin et al.  and
Pickles  are adopted. Figure 4 shows an example
of the SED fitting results.
To select the best model among the SED templates
for QSOs, inactive galaxies, and stars in describing the
observed SEDs of the QSO candidates, we employ the
Bayesian information criterion . The BIC is de-
fined as BIC = χ2 + k ln n, where k is the number of
free parameters and n is the number of the data points
in the SED. According to this criterion, a source is clas-
sified as a QSO only if the BIC for the best fit with
QSO templates is at least 10 points lower than that of
the best fit with galaxy SED templates ,
a method proven effective for QSO/galaxy classification
card heavily obscured AGNs, we impose an additional
criterion on extinction . We further refine our
selection by excluding sources whose χ2
QSO values exceed
the 97.7 %  confidence threshold.
This statistical
cutoff helps identify and remove outliers or less likely
QSO candidates based on the quality of their fit, ensur-
ing that only the most probable QSOs are retained in our
analysis.
Employing these stringent criteria enhances
the integrity and reliability of our dataset, focusing on
sources that best match the expected characteristics of
QSOs.
In the KS4 field, the final set of unobscured QSO can-
didates comprises 72,964 sources, all of which meet the
selection criteria outlined in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. We
provide a detailed multi-wavelength catalog of these can-
didates, as described in Table 1.
Unobscured QSOs with KS4

The yellow
squares are the photometric data, while the blue, red, and
gray lines represent the best-fit galaxy, QSO, and star mod-
els, respectively. The χ2 values of the models are marked in
the legend.
The most direct method to confirm our QSO can-
didates as real QSOs is to obtain their optical/near-
infrared spectra to identify the AGN features. However,
confirming all QSO candidates through individual spec-
tral observations is a cost-ineffective approach for con-
ducting QSO surveys in the southern sky. We, therefore,
anticipate relying on forthcoming spectro-photometric
surveys, such as 7DS and SPHEREx, for their direct
confirmation. Instead, we here explore the validity of
our QSO candidates through indirect methods.
To validate our selection, we compare our QSO candi-
dates with spectroscopically confirmed QSOs in the KS4
survey area. We utilize the Milliquas catalog v8 , which contains approximately 0.9 million type-
within our survey area. Specifically, within our survey
area, there are 484 QSOs classified as the core-dominant
type-1 QSOs in the catalog. Upon cross-matching with
our QSO candidates, we find only 325 QSOs, resulting
in a recovery rate of 67 %.
In Figure 3, we present the color distributions of the
KS4 or WISE photometry.
Approximately a quarter
of QSOs are rejected during the color-selection stage
neath the selection wedge of Mateos et al.  in the
left panel, a region where only a very minor fraction of
type-1 QSOs are expected to be located .
The remaining samples are rejected during the selection
based on the SED fitting . It is impor-

tant to note that the Milliquas sample is a compilation of
spectroscopically confirmed QSOs without homogenetic
selection, which may be related to the missing popula-
tions by our method.
In Figure 5, we present the distributions of redshift
QSOs within the KS4 survey area. Since our selection
criteria are optimized for identifying low-redshift, unob-
scured QSOs, the missing fraction of QSOs increases at
higher redshifts. This fraction also increases at I ≳20
mag, where the number count of reliable sources after
applying the SNR criteria drops dramatically .
As pointed out in Section 3.1, our color-selection crite-
ria are highly effective for finding low-redshift QSOs. If
we consider the QSOs with I < 20 mag at z < 2, the
numbers of selected, color/SNR-rejected, and SED-fit-
rejected QSOs are 232, 21, and 13, respectively, resulting
in a recovery rate of 87 % . It is noteworthy

for SDSS type-1 QSOs as discussed in Section 3.1. This
similarity highlights the effectiveness of our QSO selec-
tion methods for spectroscopically confirmed QSOs in
the southern sky.
As an indirect approach to validate our QSO candi-
dates, we compare their number counts per unit area
to those of spectroscopically identified QSOs from the
SDSS DR16 , spanning an area of
Furthermore, we restrict our analysis to
QSOs with a redshift lower than 2 to accommodate
the variations in number counts by redshift. The ad-
justed number counts from SDSS are represented as gray
squares in Figure 6. Note that the SDSS QSO sample is
incomplete at i′ > 19.1 mag ,
indicated by open squares in the figure.
To match the number counts of SDSS QSOs, we con-
vert KS4 magnitudes of our QSO candidates to SDSS
i′-band magnitude using the combination of transforma-
tion equations for z ≤2.1 QSOs by Jester et al. :
i′ = V −0.19 −0.9 + 0.18.
Accurately determining the effective survey area is
crucial for precise estimation of the number counts.

the power-law slopes of 0.85 for KS4 and 0.83 for SDSS

our selection method effectively reproduces the observed
abundance of real QSOs.
The inset compares the number counts of our candi-
dates, defined by various b limits, normalized to those

trends across different b thresholds, further validating
the efficacy of our selection criteria. In particular, no no-
ticeable number excess between |b| > 10◦and |b| > 40◦
suggests that our method effectively excludes stellar con-
taminants.

approach to identify candidates.
The number counts
from this sample, represented by sky-blue triangles in
Figure 6, are about twice as high as those from our can-
didates. Note that the sample used here adheres to the
higher-purity recommendations – in Yang
shifts lower than 2. Similar to our comparison with the
SDSS sample, the noted discrepancy could stem from
the previously mentioned factors. Additionally, differ-
ences may also arise from the inclusion of host-dominant
AGNs from the Miliquas catalog in the training sample,
which our selection criteria may largely overlook. The
power-law slope between 16 < i′ < 19 is slightly flatter
at 0.78, potentially reflecting the broader inclusivity of
their targeting strategy.

presents the effective area coverage for a given HEALPix
level, with areas from the n = 11 level superimposed to
enable direct comparison. The unoccupied regions are at-
tributable to the gaps between the KMTNet CCD chips,
representing incomplete regions not covered by at least four
dithered observations or the areas affected by bright stars.
We further emphasize the complementarity in sky cov-
erage between the KS4 QSO catalog and the DES DR2
catalog of Yang & Shen . These two catalogs cover
most of the southern sky , providing an ex-
tensive resource for QSO studies.

probability of being a QSO  determined by the
discrete source classifier . The Combmod proba-
bility is determined from the combination of class infor-
mation from Specmod  and Allosmod
they provide the probabilities of being a galaxy 
and a star .
In Figure 8, we present the fractional distribution of
our candidates as classified by the probabilities in Gaia
DR3.
According to Gaia DR3’s source classification,
sources are deemed QSOs, galaxies, or stars based on
the highest posterior probability exceeding 0.5. Notably,
only 64 % of our candidates are likely classified as QSOs
with PQSO > 0.5 , while a significant
portion  of the remaining sources are likely clas-
sified as stars .
This classification disparity appears to contradict the
high completeness reported for QSO and star classifi-
cations using Combmod . However, it is important to note that
these probabilities were determined using only Gaia data
in optical wavelengths.
Even if an object is a point
source with PStar > 0.5, the presence of detection in the
WISE bands suggests a significant possibility that the
object might not be a star, except for very bright sources

shown in Figure 4 and by the changes in the number
distribution after the SNR cut in the WISE bands due
to the inclusion of bright stars, shown in Figure 2. Fur-
thermore, cross-matching with the Milliquas catalog in
Section 4.1 reveals that 20 % of spectroscopically identi-
fied QSOs are assigned PStar > 0.5. Additionally, the
effectiveness of our approach in rejecting stellar con-
tamination, strengthened by the consistent trends in the
number counts across different b thresholds ,
suggests that not all sources with PStar > 0.5 in our
candidates are indeed stars. These raise concerns about
the reliability of using PQSO alone for accurate QSO se-
lection.
Given doubts about the low purity  of the Gaia
DR3 QSO candidates with PQSO selection , Storey-Fisher et al.  recently generated an
all-sky QSO catalog named Quaia, based on the combi-
nation of the Gaia DR3 and unWISE  colors,
yielding a more reliable set of QSO candidates. There
are 64,734 Quaia candidates located within the effective
survey area defined by HEALPix level n = 12, 2542 of
which are not identified in the KS4 catalog. This omis-
sion may arise from the marginal inconsistency between
the imaging data and HEALPix patches. Indeed, about
the effective survey area estimation. The fraction nat-
urally decreases if we introduce an effective survey area
defined by a higher HEALPix level . We also note that the screening with SSFLAG
has no effect because it excludes known sources.
In Figure 9, we present the i′-band distribution of
these Quaia candidates matched to the KS4 catalog and
our sample, considering the 38,534 candidates selected
both in Quaia and our work . On the
other hand, 23,593 Quaia candidates  are not se-
lected by our selection criteria; they are rejected due
to  the lack of the number of dithered observations
we select Quaia candidates using the KS4 HEALPix
maps, which cannot perfectly trace our survey area, es-
pecially at the CCD gaps. Unlike our method, Storey-
Fisher et al.  used only the W1 and W2 band
magnitudes from the unWISE catalog, which is deeper
than the AllWISE that we used, potentially explain-
ing the discrepancies in candidate selection due to SNR
and colors.
Indeed, the magnitude differences in W1
and W2 between unWISE3 and AllWISE for the Quaia
candidates excluded based on color/SNR exhibit larger
standard deviation 
compared to those candidates selected both in Quaia
and in our analysis .
This may also be attributed to either the MIR variabil-
ity between the two surveys  or
the confusion with nearby sources. On the other hand,
those rejected due to the poor SED-fitting results occupy
a large fraction of bright QSO candidates .
Most of them have χ2
QSO values higher than 2σ level, in-
dicating that they are unlikely to be probable QSOs or
nearby QSOs with the bright and extended host galax-
ies, in which the systematic uncertainties in the multi-
wavelength photometry can be significantly larger than
nucleus dominated objects.
The number of QSO candidates only in our work  is significantly high, predominantly consist-
ing of faint sources that are not likely to be observable
with Gaia. However, even at i′ ≲20 mag, the fraction
of these candidates remains nonnegligible; about 17 %
at 15 < i′ < 20.
As we discussed above, the selec-
tion efficiency of our method, validated by the recovery
rate of spectroscopically confirmed QSOs, and the num-

ber counts consistent with the other surveys, strength-
ens the fact that our QSO candidates are promising.
Therefore, spectro-photometric surveys, such as 7DS
and SPHEREx, will enable us to estimate the effective-
ness of our selection method rigorously and to constrain
the unobscured QSO population in the southern sky.
In this study, we present a catalog of unobscured
QSO candidates in the southern sky.
We mainly use
the KS4 interim data, which covers ∼2500 deg2 area
around the south ecliptic pole and achieves 5σ imaging
depths of ∼22.1–22.7 mag in the BV RI bands. Com-
bining this KS4 data with infrared photometric data
from the 2MASS , VHS , and AllWISE
for the initial selection and apply the SED fitting to re-
fine our list of plausible QSO candidates. The final cat-
alog consists of 72,964 candidates for unobscured QSOs
over an effective survey area of ∼2000 deg2. Despite
only 0.4 % of these candidates being spectroscopically
confirmed QSOs so far, the high recovery rate of 87 % for
QSOs with I < 20 mag at z < 2 proves the robustness of
our selection method. Moreover, this is also supported
by the number counts of our candidates, which are con-
sistent with those of the spectroscopically confirmed
QSOs from SDSS in the northern hemisphere. Moving
forward, upcoming spectro-photometric surveys, such as
SPHEREx and 7DS, are expected to provide valuable in-
sights into the true nature of these candidates, thereby
enhancing our understanding of QSO populations in the
southern sky.
